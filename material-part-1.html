    <p>This learning material is for the Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses held in spring
    2012 at the University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science. The material is used also for the online MOOC
    (massive open online course) programming course. The material is based on previous years' (2010 and 2011)
    course material with content contributions from: Matti Paksula, Antti Laaksonen, Pekka Mikkola, Juhana Laurinharju
    and Martin Pärtel.</p>

    <p>You should do all the example exercises yourself as you read the material. It is recommended to make changes to
    the examples yourself and observe the result of the changes on the programs. Although you might think that doing
    examples yourself will only slow down your progress, this is definitely not the case here! As far as we know, no
    one has yet learned to program merely by reading a textbook or listening to lectures. Doing activities and
    improving your routine is an essential part of the learning process. Doing the given exercise examples and, more
    importantly, making your own changes to them is one of the best ways to internalize the information you just
    read.</p>

    <p>Do or at least try to do the exercises as you proceed. If you are not able to complete an exercise on your first
    attempt, do not become discouraged as you will be able to find help (and later help others, too) on the IRC channel
    of the course.</p>

    <p>This material is not meant to be read just once. You will definitely need to return and reread sections that you
    have already read and exercises that you have already completed. This material does not cover everything essential
    to computer programming. In fact, no book in existence contains all the essentials. That means that during your
    career as a computer programmer you will also have to seek information individually. The material exercises include
    some instructions on where and how to find useful information.</p>

    <p>There are also a bunch of screencasts (i.e. instructional videos), which allow you to follow the construction of
    program rather than just reading the full example at once.</p>

            <h2>The program and the source code</h2>

            <h3>Source code</h3>

            <p>A program is made up of <em>source code</em>. A computer generally runs <em>commands</em> in the source
            code from <em>top to bottom</em> and <em>from left to right</em>. The source code is saved in a textual
            format and will be <em>executed</em> somehow.</p>

            <h3>Commands</h3>

            <p>Actually, a program is composed of commands written in the source code. Computers execute different
            <em>operations</em>, or actions, based on the commands. For example, when printing the string (i.e. text)
            "Hello world!" on the screen, <code>System.out.println</code> is the most important command.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Hello world!");
</pre>

            <p>The <code>System.out.println</code> command prints the string given to inside the brackets onto the
            screen. The suffix <code>ln</code> is short for the word <i>line</i>. Therefore, this command prints out a
            line. This means that after the given string has been printed, the command will also print a line
            break.</p>

            <h3>Compiler and interpreter</h3>

            <p>Computers do not directly understand the programming language we are using. We need a <em>compiler</em>
            between the source code and the computer. When we are programming using the command line interface, the
            command <code>javac Hello.java</code> will compile the <code>Hello.java</code> file into <i>bytecode</i>,
            which can be executed using the Java interpreter. To run the compiled program, you can use the command
            <code>java Hello</code> where Hello is the name of the original source code file.</p>

            <p>When using a modern development environment (more on this later), it will take care of compiling the
            source code. When we choose to run the program, rhw development environment will compile and execute the
            program. All development environments compile source code while it is being written by the programmer,
            which means that simple errors will be noticed before executing the program.</p>

            <h3>Components of commands</h3>

            <h4>Semicolon</h4>

            <p>A semicolon <code>;</code> is used to separate different commands. The compiler and the interpreter both
            ignore lines in the source code so we could write the entire program on a single line.</p>

            <p>In the example below we will use the <code>System.out.print</code> command, which is similar to the
            <code>System.out.println</code> command except that it will not print a line break after printing the
            text.</p>

            <p><b>Example of how the semicolons are used</b></p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.print("Hello "); System.out.print("world");
System.out.print("!");
</pre>

<pre>
Hello world!
</pre>

            <p>Even though neither the compiler nor the interpreter need line breaks in the source code, they are very
            important when considering other humans. Line breaks are required to divide source code in a clear manner.
            This and other similar matters related to readability will emphasized throughout this course.</p>

            <h4>Parameters (information passed to commands)</h4>

            <p>The information processed by a command are the <em>parameters of a command</em>. They are passed to the
            command by placing them between <code>()</code> brackets that follow the command name. For example, the
            <code>System.out.print</code> command is given the text <em>hello</em> as a parameter as follows:
            <code>System.out.print("hello")</code>.</p>

            <h4>Comments</h4>

            <p><em>Comments</em> are a useful way to make notes in the source code for yourself and others. Everything
            on a line after two forward slashes <code>//</code> are treated as a comment.</p>

            <h4>Example of using comments</h4>

<pre class="sh_java">
// We will print the text "Hello world"
System.out.print("Hello world");

System.out.print(" and all the people of the world."); // We print more text to the same line.

// System.out.print("this line will not be executed, because it is commented out");
</pre>

            <p>The last line of the example introduces a particularly handy use for comments: you can comment out code
            instead of completely deleting it if you want to temporarily try something out.</p>

            <h3>3.5 More about printing</h3>

            <p>As we can tell from the examples above, there are two commands for printing.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>System.out.print</code> prints the text without the line break at the end</li>

                <li><code>System.out.println</code> prints the text and the line break</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The printed text can contain both traditional characters and special characters. The most important
            special character is <code>\n</code>, which stands for a line break. There are also other <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character" title=
            "Escape character - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">special characters</a>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("First\nSecond\nThird");
</pre>

            <p>When executed, the example above prints:</p>

<pre>
First
Second
Third
</pre>

            <h2>Main program body</h2>

            <p>The body for a program named "Example" as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // program code
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>The program is stored in a text file named after the program with the <i>.java</i> extension. For a
            program named <i>Example</i>, the file should be named <code>Example.java</code>.</p>

            <p>The execution of the program begins at the part marked with the <i>// program code</i> comment above.
            During our first week of programming, we will limit ourselves to this part. When we are talking about
            commands such as printing, we need to write the commands into the program body. For example:
            <code>System.out.print("Text to be printed");</code></p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("Text to be printed");
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>From this point on, the main program body will be omitted from the examples.</p>

            <h2>Getting to know your development environment</h2>

            <p>Programming these days takes place in development environments almost without exceptions. The
            development environment provides several tools and features to assist the programmer. Although the
            development environment does not write the program on behalf of the programmer, it contains several handy
            features such as hinting about mistakes in code and assisting the programmer to visualize the structure
            of the program.</p>

            <div class="help">
                <p>For this course, we will use the <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> development
                  environment. A guide for using NetBeans is available <a href="/programming-part1/registration-and-how-get-started#nb">here</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Until you become familiar with NetBeans, follow the guides and steps precisely. Most of the following
            exercises show what needs to be printed to the screen for the program to function correctly.</p>

            <p><b>Note:</b> Do not do the examples by writing code and then clicking the test button. You should also
            execute the code manually (green arrow) and observe the result on the screen. This is especially useful if
            an exercise fails to pass the tests.</p>

            <div class="tehtavat">
                <p>In the following exercises, we will practice using NetBeans and printing text to the screen.</p>

                    <h3 class="req">Name</h3>

                    <p>Create a program that prints your name to the screen.</p>

                    <p>The program output should resemble the following:</p>

<pre>

                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3>Hello world! (And all the people of the world)</h3>

                    <p>Create a program that prints out the following:</p>

<pre>
Hello world!
(And all the people of the world)
</pre>
                </div>

                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3 class="req">Spruce</h3>

<pre>
    
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    *
</pre>
                </div>

                <p><b>Note:</b> You probably wrote <code>System.out.println("...")</code> quite a few times.
                Try to type only <i>sout</i> on an empty line in NetBeans instead and then press the <a href=

            <h2 id="muuttuja_ja_sijoitus">Variables and assignment</h2>

            <h3>Variables and data types</h3>

            <p>A <em>variable</em> is one of the most important concepts in computer programming. A variable should be
            imagined as a box in which you can store information. The information stored in a variable always has a
            type. These types include text (<em>String</em>), whole numbers (<em>int</em>), decimal numbers
            (<em>double</em>), and truth value (<em>boolean</em>). A <em>value</em> can be assigned to a variable using
            the equals sign (<code>=</code>).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int months = 12;
</pre>

            <p>In the statement above, we assign the value 12 to the variable named <em>months</em> whose data type is
            whole number (<em>int</em>). The statement is read as "the variable <em>months</em> is assigned the
            <em>value</em> 12".</p>

            <p>The value of the variable can be appended to a string with the plus <code>+</code> sign as shown in the
            following example.</p>

            <!-- <h4>Esimerkkejä muuttujista ja tietotyypeistä</h4> -->

<pre class="sh_java">
String text = "includes text";
int wholeNumber = 123;
double decimalNumber = 3.141592653;
boolean isTrue = true;

System.out.println("The variable's type is text. Its value is " + text);
System.out.println("The variable's type is whole number. Its value is  " + wholeNumber);
System.out.println("The variable's type is decimal number. Its value is " + decimalNumber);
System.out.println("The variable's type is truth value. Its value is " + isTrue);
</pre>

            <p>Printing:</p>

<pre>
The variable's type is text. Its value is includes text
The variable's type is whole number. Its value is 123
The variable's type is decimal number. Its value is 3.141592653
The variable's type is truth value. Its value is true
</pre>

            <p>A variables holds its value until it is assigned a new one. Note that the variable type is written only
            when the variable is first declared in the program. After that we can use the variable by its name.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int wholeNumber = 123;
System.out.println("The variable's type is whole number. Its value is  " + wholeNumber);

wholeNumber = 42;
System.out.println("The variable's type is whole number. Its value is  " + wholeNumber);
</pre>

            <p>The output is:</p>

<pre>
The variable's type is whole number. Its value is 123
The variable's type is whole number. Its value is 42
</pre>

            <h3>Variable data types are immutable</h3>

            <p>When a variable is declared with a data type, it cannot be changed later. For example, a text variable
            cannot be changed into an integer variable and it cannot be assigned integer values.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String text = "yabbadabbadoo!";
text = 42; // Does not work! :(
</pre>

            <p>Whole numbers values can be assigned to decimal number variables, because whole numbers are also
            decimal numbers.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
double decimalNumber = 0.42;
decimalNumber = 1; // Works! :)
</pre>

            <div class="tehtavat">
                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3 class="req">Varying variables</h3>

                    <p>The exercise file initially contains a program which prints:</p>

<pre>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Allowed and descriptive variable names</h3>

            <p>There are certain limitations on the naming of our variables. Even though umlauts, for example, can
            can be used, it is better to avoid them, because problems might arise with <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding" title=
            "Character encoding - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">character encoding</a>. For example, it is
            reccomended to use A instead of Ä.</p>

            <p>Variable names must not contain certain special characters like exclamation marks (!). Space characters
            cannot be used, either, as it is used to separate commands into multiple parts. It is a good idea to
            replace the space character using a <em><a href="http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase" title=
            "CamelCase – Wikipedia">camelCase</a></em> notation. <b>Note:</b> The first character is always written
            in lower case when using the camel case notation.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int camelCaseVariable = 7;
</pre>

            <p>Variable names can contain numbers as long it does not start with one. Variable names cannot be composed
            solely of numbers, either.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int 7variable = 4; // Not allowed!
int variable7 = 4; // A valid, but not descriptive variable name
</pre>

            <p>Variable names that have been defined before cannot be used. Command names such as
            <code>System.out.print</code> cannot be used, either.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int camelCase = 2;
int camelCase = 5; // Not allowed, the variable camelCase is already defined!
</pre>

            <p>It is strongly recommended to name variables such that their purpose can be understood without comments
            and without thinking. Variable names used in this course <strong>must</strong> be descriptive.</p>

            <h4>Valid variable names</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>lastDay = 20</li>
                <li>firstYear = 1952</li>
                <li>name = "Matti"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Invalid variable names</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>last day of the month = 20</li>
                <li>1day = 1952</li>
                <li>watchout! = 1910</li>
                <li>1920 = 1</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="laskentaa">Calculation</h2>

            <p>The calculation operations are pretty straightforward: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>
            and <code>/</code>. A more peculiar operation is the modulo operation <code>%</code>, which calculates the
            remainder of a division. The order of operations is also pretty straightforward: the operations are
            calculated from left to right taking the brackets into account.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 2;   // variable of whole number type is assigned the value 2
int second = 4;  // variable of whole number type is assigned the value 4
int sum = first + second;  // variable of whole number type is assigned the value of first + second (which means 2 + 4)

System.out.println(sum); // the value of the variable sum is printed
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
int calcWithBrackets = (1 + 1) + 3 * (2 + 5);  // 23
int calcWithoutBrackets = 1 + 1 + 3 * 2 + 5;   // 13
</pre>

            <p>The bracket example above can also be done step by step.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int calcWithBrackets = (1 + 1);
calcWithBrackets = calcWithBrackets + 3 * (2 + 5);  // 32

int calcWithoutBrackets = 1 + 1;
calcWithoutBrackets = calcWithoutBrackets + 3 * 2;
calcWithoutBrackets = calcWithoutBrackets + 5;      // 13
</pre>

            <p>Calculation operations can be used almost anywhere in the program code.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 2;
int second = 4;

System.out.println(first + second);
System.out.println(2 + second - first - second);
</pre>

            <h3>Floating point numbers (decimal numbers)</h3>

            <p>Calculating the division and remainder of whole numbers is a little trickier. A floating point number
            (decimal number) and integer (whole number) often get mixed up. If all the variables in a
            calculation operation are integers, the end result will also be an integer.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int result = 3 / 2;  // result is 1 (integer) because 3 and 2 are integers as well
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 3:
int second = 2;
double result = first / second;  // the result is again 1 because first and second are integers
</pre>

            <p>The remainder can be calculated using the remainder operation (<code>%</code>). For example, the
            calculation <code>7 % 2</code> yields 1.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int remainder = 7 % 2;  // remainder is 1 (integer)
</pre>

            <p>If either the dividend or the divider (or both!) is a floating point number (decimal number) the end
            result will also be a floating point number.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
double whenDividendIsFloat = 3.0 / 2;  // result is: 1.5
double whenDividerIsFloat = 3 / 2.0;   // result is: 1.5
</pre>

            <p>If needed, integers can be converted to floating point using the type cast operation
            <code>(double)</code> as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 3;
int second = 2;
double result1 = (double)first / second;  // result is: 1.5

double result2 = first / (double)second;  // result is: 1.5

double result3 = (double)(first / second);  // result is: 1
</pre>

            <p>In the last example calculation, the result is rounded incorrectly because the calculation between the
            integers is done before the type cast to a floating point number.</p>

            <p>If the quotient is assigned to a variable of integer type, the result will be an integer as well.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int integerResultBecauseTypeIsInteger = 3.0 / 2;  // quotient is automatically integer: 1
</pre>

            <p>The next example will print "1.5" because the dividend is transformed into a floating point number by
            multiplying it with a floating point number (1.0 * 3 = 3.0) before the division.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int dividend = 3;
int divider = 2;

double quotient = 1.0 * dividend / divider;
System.out.println(quotient); 
</pre>

            <p>What does the following code print?</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int dividend = 3;
int divider = 2;

double quotient = dividend / divider * 1.0;
System.out.println(quotinent);
</pre>

            <p><big>From now on, make sure that you name your variables that follow good conventions like the variables
            in the examples above.</big></p>

                    <p>Create a program that counts how many seconds there are in a year. You can assume that a year

            <h2 id="katenointi">Concatenation or combining strings</h2>

            <p>Let us take a closer look on combining strings with the <code>+</code> operator.</p>

            <p>If the <code>+</code> operator is used between two strings, a new string is created with the two strings
            combined. Note the clever use of a space character as a part of the "variables" below!</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String greeting = "Hi ";
String name = "John";
String goodbye = ", and goodbye!";

String sentence = greeting + name + goodbye;

System.out.println(sentence);
</pre>

<pre>
Hi John, and goodbye!
</pre>

            <p>If a string is on either side of the <code>+</code> operator, the other side is converted to a string
            and a new string is created. For example, the integer <code>2</code> will be converted into the string
            "2" and then combined with the other string.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("there is an integer --&gt; " + 2);
System.out.println(2 + " &lt;-- there is an integer");
</pre>

            <p>What we learned earlier about the order of operations is still valid:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Four: " + (2 + 2));
System.out.println("But! Twenty-two: " + 2 + 2);
</pre>

<pre>
Four: 4
But! Twenty-two: 22
</pre>

            <p>Using this information, we can print a mix of strings and values of variables:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int x = 10;

System.out.println("variable x has the following value: " + x);

int y = 5;
int z = 6;

System.out.println("y has the value  " + y + " and z has the value " + z);
</pre>

            <p>This program obviously prints:</p>

<pre>
variable x has the following value: 10
y has the value 5 and z has the value 6
</pre>

                    <p>Create a program used to calculate the sum of two numbers. At the beginning of the program two
                    variables are introduced and those variables hold the numbers to be summed. Feel free to use other
                    variables if you need to.</p>

                    <p>For example, if the variables hold numbers 5 and 4, the program should output:</p>

            <h2 id="syötteen_lukeminen">Reading user input</h2>

            <p>So far our programs have been rather one-sided. Next we will learn how to read <em>input</em> from the
            user. We will use a special <em>Scanner</em> tool to read the user input.</p>

            <p>Let us add the <em>Scanner</em> to our existing main program body. Do not worry if the main program body
            seems obscure as we will continue to write our code in the part marked <em>// program code</em>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProgramBody {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    // program code
  }
}
</pre>

            <h3 id="syote_simppeli">Reading a string</h3>

            <p>The following code reads the user's name and prints a greeting:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.print("What is your name? ");
String name = reader.nextLine(); // Reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable called name

System.out.println("Hi, " + name);
</pre>

<pre>
What is your name? <span class="red">John</span>
Hi, John
</pre>

            <p>The program above combined along with the main program body is below. The name of the program is
            <em>Greeting</em>, which means that it must be located in a file named <code>Greeting.java</code>. With
            NetBeans, you can follow the original <a href="%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D">guide</a>, but be sure to change the
            program name from Hello to Greeting.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Greeting {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Who is greeted: ");
    String nimi = reader.nextLine(); // Reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable called name

    System.out.print("Hi " + name);
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>When the program above is executed, you can type the input. The output tab in NetBeans (on the bottom)
            looks like this when the program has finished (the user inputs the name "John").</p>

<pre>
run:
Who is greeted: John
Hi John
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 6 seconds)
</pre>

            <h3 id="syote_kokonaisluku">Reading integers</h3>

            <p>Our Scanner tool is not good for reading integers, so we will use another special tool to convert a
            string to an integer. The command <code>Integer.parseInt</code> converts the string given to it into an
            integer. The command is given its parameter between brackets and it returns an integer that can be
            assigned to a integer variable.</p>

            <p>We are practically joining two commands together. First we read the input as a string from the user and
            immediately give it to the command <code>Integer.parseInt</code>.</p>

<!--
<pre class="sh_java">
String threeString = "3";
int three = Integer.parseInt(threeString);
</pre>

        <p>Here is the same example, except that now we read the input from the user as a string using Scanner.</p>


<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.print("Type an integer: ");
String numberString = reader.nextLine();
int number = Integer.parseInt(numberString);

System.out.println("You typed " + number);
</pre>
        <p>Usually commands can also be chained. Let us use the string we get from readers <code>nextLine</code> command directly in another command <code>Integer.parseInt</code>. Now first the reader takes the users input as a string, then the command <code>Integer.parseInt</code> transforms the string to an integer. From now on we will use the following way to read integers from the user.</p>
//-->

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.print("Type an integer: ");
int number = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

System.out.println("You typed " + number);
</pre>

            <p>Next we will ask the user to give us his name and age. The program body is included this time.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NameAndAgeGreeting {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Your name: ");
    String name = reader.nextLine();   // Reads a line from the users keyboard

    System.out.print("How old are you: ");
    int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine()); // Reads a string variable from the users keyboard and transfers it to an integer

    System.out.println("Your name is: " + name + ", and you are " + age + " years old, nice to meet you!");

                    <p>After that the players are printed with the command <code>top</code> using the number of players
                    to be printed as its parameter.<br></p>

                    <p>It is also possible to use the component to request the the statistics of a certain player:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
NHLStatistics.teamStatistics("NYR");  // Statistics of New York Rangers

                    <p>The order of the printed club statistics can be changed using a <code>sortBy...()</code>

            <h2 id="valinta_ja_totuusarvot">Conditional statements and truth values</h2>

            <p>So far, our programs have progressed from one command to another in a straightforward manner. In order
            for the program to <em>branch</em> to different execution paths based on e.g. user input, we need
            conditional statements.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 11;

if (number &gt; 10) {
    System.out.println("The number was greater than 10");
}
</pre>

            <p>The condition <code>(number &gt; 10)</code> evaluates into a truth value; either <em>true</em> or
            <em>false</em>. So, in the end, the <code>if</code> command only handles truth values. The conditional
            statement above is read as "if the number is greater than 10".</p>

            <p>Note that the <code>if</code> statement is not followed by semicolon as the condition path continues
            after the statement.</p>

            <p>After the condition, the opening brace <code>{</code> starts a new <em>block</em>, which is executed
            if the condition is true. The <em>block</em> ends with a closing brace <code>}</code>. Block can be as
            long as desired.</p>

            <p>The comparison operators are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>&gt;</code> Greater than</li>
                <li><code>&gt;=</code> Greater than or equal to</li>
                <li><code>&lt;</code> Less than</li>
                <li><code>&lt;=</code> Less than or equal to</li>
                <li><code>==</code> Equals</li>
                <li><code>!=</code> Not equal</li>
            </ul>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 55;

if (number != 0) {
    System.out.println("The number was not equal to 0");
}

if (number &gt;= 1000) {
    System.out.println("The number was greater than or equal to 1000");  
}

</pre>

            <p>A block can contain any code including other <code>if</code> statements.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int x = 45;
int number = 55;

if (number &gt; 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive!");
    if (number &gt; x) {
        System.out.println(" and greater than the value of variable x"); 
        System.out.println("after all, the value of variable x is " + x);
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>The comparison operators can also be used outside the <code>if</code> statements. In that case the truth
            value will be stored in a truth value variable.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 1;
int second = 3;

boolean isGreater = first &gt; second;
</pre>

            <p>In the example above the boolean (i.e. a truth value) variable <code>isGreater</code> now includes the
            truth value <em>false</em>.</p>

            <p>A boolean variable can be used as a condition in a conditional sentence.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 1;
int second = 3;

boolean isLesser = first &lt; second;

if (isLesser) {
    System.out.println("1 is less than 3!");
}
</pre>

<pre>
1 is less than 3!
</pre>

            <h3>Code indentation</h3>

            <p>Note that the commands in the block following the <code>if</code> statement (i.e. the lines after the
            <code>{</code> brace) are not written at the same level as the <code>if</code> statement itself. They
            should be <b>indented</b> slightly to the right. Indentation happens when you press the tab key, which is
            located to the left of q key. When the block ends with the closing brace, indentation ends as well. The
            closing brace <code>}</code> should be on the same level as the original <code>if</code> statement.</p>

            <p>Using indentation is crucial to the readability of program code. During this course and generally
            everywhere, you are expected to indent the code properly. NetBeans helps with the correct indentation.
            You can easily indent your program by pressing shift, alt, and f simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>else</h3>

            <p>If the truth value of the comparison is false, another optional block can be executed using the
            <code>else</code> command.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 4;

if (number &gt; 5) {
    System.out.println("Your number is greater than five!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Your number is equal to or less than five!");
}
</pre>

<pre>
Your number is equal to or less than five!

                    odd.</p>

<pre>
Type a number: <font color="red">2</font>
Number 2 is even.
</pre>

<pre>
Type a number: <font color="red">7</font>

</pre>

                    <p><b>Hint:</b> The number's remainder when dividing by 2 tells whether the number is even or odd.
                    The remainder can be obtained with the <code>%</code> operator.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>else if</h3>

            <p>If there are more than two conditions for the program to check, it is recommended to use the <code>else
            if</code> command. It works like the <code>else</code> command, but with an additional condition.
            <code>else if</code> comes after the <code>if</code> command. There can be multiple <code>else if</code>
            commands.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 3;

if (number == 1) {
    System.out.println("The number is one.");
} else if (number == 2) {
    System.out.println("The number is two.");
} else if (number == 3) {
    System.out.println("The number is three!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Quite a lot!");
}
</pre>

<pre>
The number is three!
</pre>

            <p>Let us read the example above out loud: If number is one, print out "The number is one.".
            Otherwise if the number is two, print out "The number is two.". Otherwise if the number is three,
            print out "The number is three!". Otherwise print out "Quite a lot!"</p>

            <h3>Comparing strings</h3>

            <p>Strings cannot be compared using the equality operator (<em>==</em>). For string comparison, we use the
            <code>equals</code>. command, which is always associated with the string to compare.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String text = "course";

if (text.equals("marzipan")) {
    System.out.println("The variable text contains the text marzipan");
} else {
    System.out.println("The variable text does not contain the text marzipan");
}
</pre>

            <p>The <code>equals</code> command is always attached to the string variable to compare with a dot in
            between. A string variable can also compared to another string variable.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String text = "course";
String anotherText = "horse";

if (text.equals(anotherText)) {
    System.out.println("The texts are the same!");
} else {
    System.out.println("The texts are not the same!");
}
</pre>

            <p>When comparing strings, it is crucial to make sure that both string variables have been assigned some
            value. If a value has not been assigned, the program execution terminates with a
            <i>NullPointerException</i> error, which means that variable has no value assigned to it (<i>null</i>).</p>

                    <p>Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints the greater of those two. The
                    program should also handle the case in which the two numbers are equal.</p>

                    <p>Example outputs:</p>

<pre>

            <h3>Logical operations</h3>

            <p>The condition statements can also be more complicated using logical operations. The logical operations
            are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2</code> is true if both conditions are true.</li>
                <li><code>condition1 || condition2</code> is true if either of the conditions are true.</li>
                <li><code>!condition</code> is true if the condition is false.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Below we will use the AND operation <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to combine two individual conditions in
            order to check if the value of the variable is greater than 4 <strong>and</strong> less than 11 (i.e. in
            the range 5 - 10).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Is the number between 5-10?");
int number = 7;

if (number &gt; 4 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 11) {
    System.out.println("Yes! :)");
} else {
    System.out.println("Nope :(")
}
</pre>

<pre>
Is the number between 5-10?
Yes! :)
</pre>

            <p>Next up is the OR operation <code>||</code>, which will be used to check if the value is less than 0
            <strong>or</strong> greater than 100. The condition evaluates to true if the value fulfills either
            condition.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Is the number less than 0 or greater than 100?");
int number = 145;

if (number &lt; 0 || number &gt; 100) {
    System.out.println("Yes! :)");
} else {
    System.out.println("Nope :(")
}
</pre>

<pre>
Is the number less than 0 or greater than 100?
Yes! :)
</pre>

            <p>Now we will use the negation operation <code>!</code> to negate the condition:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Is the string equal to 'milk'?");
String text = "water";

if (!(text.equals("milk"))) {  // true if the condition text.equals("milk") is false
    System.out.println("No!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Yes")
}
</pre>

<pre>
Is the text equal to 'milk'?
No!
</pre>

            <p>For complicated conditions, we often need brackets:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 99;

if ((number &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 10) || number &gt; 100 ) {
    System.out.println("The number was in the range 1-9 or it was over 100"); 
} else {
    System.out.println("The number was equal to or less than 0 or it was in the range 10-99");
}
</pre>

            <h2 id="toiston_alkeet">Introduction to loops</h2>

            <p>Conditional statements allow us to execute different commands based on the conditions. For example, we
            can let the user login only if the username and password are correct.</p>

            <p>In addition to conditions we also need repetitions. We may, for example, need to keep asking the user
            to input a username and password until a valid pair is entered.</p>

            <p>The most simple repetition is an infinite loop. The following code will print out the string <em>I
            can program!</em> forever or "an infinite number of times":</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
while (true) {
    System.out.println("I can program!");
}
</pre>

            <p>In the example above, the <code>while (true)</code> command causes the associated block (i.e. the code
            between the braces <code>{}</code>) to be <em>looped</em> (or repeated) infinitely.</p>

            <p>We generally do not want an infinite loop. The loop can be interrupted using e.g. the <code>break</code>
            command.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
while (true) {
    System.out.println("I can program!");

    System.out.print("Continue? ('no' to quit)? ");
    String command = reader.nextLine();
    if (command.equals("no")) {
        break;
    }

System.out.println("Thank you and see you later!");
</pre>

            <p>Now the loop progresses like this: First, the program prints <em>I can program!</em>. Then, the program
            program will ask the user if it should continue. If the user types in <em>no</em>, the <code>break</code>
            command is executed and the loop is interrupted and <em>Thank you and see you again!</em> is printed.</p>

<pre>
I can program!
Continue? ('no' to quit)?<font color="red">yeah</font>
I can program!
Continue? ('no' to quit)? <font color="red">jawohl</font>

            <p>Many different things can be done inside a loop. Next we create a simple calculator, which performs
            calculations based on commands that the user enters. If the command is <em>quit</em>, the
            <code>break</code> command will be executed to end the loop. Otherwise two numbers are asked. Then, if the
            initial command was <em>sum</em>, the program calculates and prints the sum of the two numbers. If the
            command was <em>difference</em>, the program calculates and prints the difference of the two numbers. If
            the command was something else, the program reports that the command was unknown.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("welcome to the calculator");

while (true) {

</pre>

                    <p>The program will be done in three steps.</p>

                    <h4>Asking for the password</h4>

                    <p>The initial exercise template defines the variable <code>String password</code> with a value of

                    a password and then compare it with the value in the variable <code>password</code>. Remember what
                    that there is a special way to compare strings!</p>

                    <h4>Asking for the password until the user gives the correct one</h4>

                    <p>Modify the program so that it asks the user to type a password until it gets the correct one.
                    Implement this using a <code>while-true</code> loop statement. The loop statement can be
                    interrupted only if and only if the entered password matches the is equal to the value of the
                    <code>password</code> variable.</p>

                    <h4>Secret message</h4>

                    <p>Add your own secret message to the program and show it to the user when the password is correct.

                    <h4>Asking for numbers</h4>

                    <p>Create a program that asks the user to input floating point numbers (<code>double</code>) and

                    <p>We will continue using the NHL component introduced earlier and create a program that the user
                    can use to query for statistics.</p>

                    <p>The program is structured similarly to the Calculator example program above. The program body
                    is as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("NHL statistics service");
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("");
        System.out.print("command (points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club, quit): ");
        String command = reader.nextLine();

        if (command.equals("quit")) {
            break;
        }

        if (command.equals("points")) {
            // print the top ten playes sorted by points
        } else if (command.equals("goals")) {
            // print the top ten players sorted by goals
        } else if (command.equals("assists")) {
            // print the top ten players sorted by assists
        } else if (command.equals("penalties")) {
            // print the top ten players sorted by penalties
        } else if (command.equals("player")) {
            // ask the user for the player name and print the statistics for that player
        } else if (scommand.equals("club")) {
            // ask the user for the club abbreviation and print the statistics for the club
            // note: the statistics should be sorted by points (players with the most points are first)
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>So the program asks the user to give commands and then executes the operation that is associated
                    with the given command. The commands are: <em>points, goals, assists, penalties, player, club,
                    quit</em>.</p>

                    <p>You should write code in the parts marked with comments.</p>

            <h2>Changing variables</h2>

            <p>Usually we want to change the value of an existing variable. This can be done using the normal
            assignment statement. In the next example, we increase the value of the variable <code>age</code> by
            one:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int age = 1;

System.out.println(age);  // prints 1
age = age + 1;            // the new value of age is the old value of age + 1    
System.out.println(age);  // prints 2
</pre>

            <p>The <code>age = age + 1</code> statement increments the value of the variable <code>age</code> by one.
            It is also possible to increment a variable by one this way:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int age = 1;

System.out.println(age);  // prints 1
age++;                    // means the same as age = age + 1
System.out.println(age);  // prints 2
</pre>

            <p>Another example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int length = 100;

System.out.println(length);  // prints 100
length = length - 50;    
System.out.println(length);  // prints 50
length = length * 2;
System.out.println(length);  // prints 100 
length = length / 4;
System.out.println(length);  // prints 25
length--;                    // means the same as length = length - 1;
System.out.println(length);  // prints 24

            <h2 id="lisaa_toistoa">More loops</h2>

            <p>Previously we have learned to use repetition using the <code>while (true)</code> loop, which repeats
            commands until the <code>break</code> command is used.</p>

            <p>The <code>break</code> command is not the only way to end the loop. A common structure for a loop
            is <code>while (condition)</code>, where the condition can be any statement that evaluates to a truth
            value. This means that the condition works exactly like conditions for an <code>if</code> statements.</p>

            <p>In the following example, we print the numbers 1, 2, …, 10. When the value of the variable
            <code>number</code> increases to be over 10, the condition of the <code>while</code> statement is no longer
            true so the loop ends.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 1;

while (number &lt; 11) {
  System.out.println(number);
  number++;  // number++ means the same as number = number + 1
}
</pre>

            <p>The exampel above can be read "as long as the variable number is less than 11, print the variable and
            increment it by one".</p>

            <p>Above, the variable <code>number</code> was incremented on each iteration of the loop. The change can be
            anything, meaning that the variable used in the condition does not always need to be incremented. For
            example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 1024;

while (number &gt;= 1) {
  System.out.println(number);
  number = number / 2;

            <h3>Assignment operations</h3>

            <p>Because changing the value of a variable is a very common operation, Java has special assignment
            operations for it.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int length = 100;

lenght += 10;  // same as length = length + 10;
length -= 50;  // same as length = length - 50;
</pre>

            <p>When performing the assignment operation on an existing variable, it is written as
            <code>variable operation= change</code>, for example <code>variable += 5</code>. Note that a variable must
            be defined before you can assign a value to it. Defining a variable is done by specifying the variable
            type and the name of the variable.</p>

            <p>The following example will not work because the type of the variable <code>length</code> has not been
            defined.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
length = length + 100;  // error!
length += 100;          // error!
</pre>

            <p>When the type is defined, the operations will also work.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int length = 0;
length = length + 100;
length += 100;

// the variable length now holds the value 200
</pre>

            <p>There are also other assignment operations:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int length = 100;

length *= 10;   // same as length = length * 10; 
length /= 100;  // same as length = length / 100;
length %= 3;    // same as length = length % 3;

// the variable length now holds the value 1
</pre>

            <p>Often during a loop, the value of a variable is calculated based on the repetition. The following
            calculates 3*4 somewhat clumsily as a sum of 3+3+3+3:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int result = 0;

int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 4) {
   result = result + 3;
   i++;  // means the same as i = i + 1;
}
</pre>

            <p>In the beginning <code>result = 0</code>. During the loop, the value of the variable is incremented
            by 3 on each iteration. And because there are 4 iterations, the value of the variable is 3*4 in the end.</p>

            <p>Using the assignment operator introduced above, we can achieve the same behavior as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int result = 0;

int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 4) {
   result += 3;  // this is the same as result = result + 3;
   i++;          // means the same as i = i+1;
}
</pre>

                    in your program to remember how many times the block has been executed. Use also another
                    helper variable to store the sum. During each execution add the value of the helper variable that
                    counts the executions to the variable in which you should collect the sum.</p>

                    2<sup>4</sup> = 2*2*2*2 = 16. In Java we cannot write a<sup>b</sup> directly, but instead we can
                    calculate the power with the command <code>Math.pow(number, power)</code>. Note that the command
                    returns a number of <code>double</code> type (i.e. floating point number). A double can be
                    converted into the <code>int</code> type (i.e. whole number) as follows:
                    <code>int result = (int)Math.pow(2, 3)</code>. This assigns the value of 2<sup>3</sup> to variable
                    result.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Infinite loop</h3>

            <p>One of the classic errors in programming is to accidentally create an infinite loop. In the next example
            we try to print "Never again shall I program an eternal loop!" 10 times:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int i = 0;

while (i &lt; 10) {
  System.out.println("Never again shall I program an eternal loop!");
}
</pre>

            <p>The variable <code>i</code>, which determines the number of loop, is initially set to 0. The block is
            supposed to be looped as long as the condition <code>i &lt; 10</code> is true. But something funny happens
            here. Because the value of the variable <code>i</code> is never changed, the condition stays true forever.</p>

            <h3>Ending a while loop</h3>

            <p>So far, we have used the while loop with a structure similar to this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int i = 1;
while (i &lt; 10) {
  // Some code.
  i++;
}
</pre>

            <p>With the structure above, the variable <code>i</code> remembers the number of times the the loop has
            been executed. The condition to end the loop is based on comparing the value of <code>i</code>.</p>

            <p>Let us now recall how a while loop is stopped. Ending a while loop does not need to always be based on
            the number of loops. The next example program asks for the user's age. If the given age is not in the range
            5-85, the program prints a message and asks for the user's age again. As you can see, the condition for the
            while loop can be any expression that results in a boolean (truth value).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Type your age: ");

int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

while (age &lt; 5 || age &gt; 85) {  // age less than 5 OR greater than 85
    System.out.println("You are lying!");
    if (age &lt; 5) {
        System.out.println("You are so young that you cannot know how to write!");   
    } else if (age &gt; 85) {
        System.out.println("You are so old that you cannot know how to use a computer!");   
    } 

    System.out.println("Type your age again: ");
    age = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine();
}

System.out.println("Your age is " + age);
</pre>

            <p>The program could have also been implemented using the good old <code>while (true)</code> structure:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.println("Type your age ");

while (true) {
    int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

    if (age &gt;= 5 &amp;&amp; age &lt;= 85) {  // age between 5 AND 85
        break;  // end the loop
    }

    System.out.println("You are lying!");
    if (age &lt; 5) {
        System.out.println("You are so young that you cannot know how to write!");   
    } else {  // that means age is over 85
        System.out.println("You are so old that you cannot know how to use a computer!");   
    } 

    System.out.println("Type your age again: ");
}

System.out.println("Your age is " + age);
</pre>

                    adding features exercise by exercise. If you do not finish all the exercises you can still send
                    them to be reviewed by the exercise robot. You can do that by clicking the "submit"

                    <p>Note: from now on every sub-exercise of a larger exercise (like 36.1) has the same value as an

                <big><big><b>Note: creating a program in small steps</b></big></big>

                <p>In these exercises we actually created one single program, but programming happened in very small
                steps. This is <b>ALWAYS</b> the preferred way to program.</p>

                <p>When you are programming something, no matter if it is an exercise or a project of your own, it is
                advised to do it in very tiny pieces. Do not ever try to solve the whole problem in one go. Start with
                something easy, something you know that you can do. In this recent set of exercises, for example, we
                focused first on stopping the program when the user types -1. When one part of the program is made and
                working, we can move on to working out the solution for the next sub-problem of the big main
                problem.</p>

                <p>Part of the exercises on this course are sliced into smaller pieces like the set of exercises we
                just introduced. Usually the pieces need to be sliced again into smaller pieces considering the
                programming solution. It is advised that you execute the whole program after almost every new line of
                code you have written. That way you can make sure that your solution is going in the right and working
                direction.</p>
                <hr>
            </div>

            <h2 id="metodit1">Methods</h2>

            <p>We have now used many different commands in Java, including assignment, calculations, comparison, if
            structures and while structures. We have been using a "command" <code>System.out.println()</code>
            to print. We can count the maximum of two numbers with the help of the "command"
            <code>Math.max()</code>. We are also familiar with <code>reader.nextLine()</code>, usually seen together
            with <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>.</p>

            <p>If we take a closer look we notice that those commands differ from if and while (etc). The first
            difference is that after the command there are brackets () and sometimes an input for the command inside
            those brackets. Actually the commands ending with brackets are not called commands but
            <strong>methods</strong>.</p>

            <p>Technically a method is a piece of code that can be called from different places of the program code.
            The line of code <code>System.out.println("I am a parameter given to the method!")</code> means
            that we call a method that actually handles the printing. After the method has been executed we go back
            where we called the method and continue executing. The input given to the method inside the brackets is
            called a <i>method parameter</i>.</p>

            <p>In addition to a parameter, the method can also have a return value, for example, a familiar line of
            code:</p>

<pre class="java">
int number = Integer.parseInt( reader.nextLine() );
</pre>

            <p>includes two method calls. First the inner method <code>reader.nextLine</code> is called. That method
            has the integer typed by the user as a return value. Next the outer method <code>Integer.parseInt</code> is
            called. As a parameter for that method there is the string of characters that was received from the
            <code>reader.nextLine</code> method as a return value. The return value for the method
            <code>Integer.parseInt</code> is the string of characters transformed into an integer (number).</p>

            <p>Method names also seem to include a dot, for example <code>reader.nextLine()</code>. Actually the method
            name starts after the dot, here it is <code>nextLine()</code>. The first part of the command that comes
            before the dot shows whose method is in question, here the method belongs to the reader. So we have the
            <em>reader's</em> method <em>nextLine</em>. Later we will learn more precisely about the method owner
            (or the name on the left side of the dot). An attentive reader will notice that the method
            <code>System.out.println()</code> has two dots. Here, the method name is println and
            <code>System.out</code> is the owner of the method. Roughly <code>System.out</code> means the computer
            monitor.</p>

            <p>This far we have been using ready-made methods from Java libraries. Next we will learn how to do our own
            methods.</p>

            <h2 id="metodit">Self-written methods</h2>

            <p>This far we have been using a programming style where code is written (and read and executed) from top
            to bottom.</p>

            <p>Before it was mentioned that "a method is a piece of code that can be called from different places
            of the program code". Ready-made methods of Java have been used since our very first program.</p>

            <p>In addition to using these ready-made methods the programmer can write their own methods for the program
            to call. In the real world it is really exceptional if the program does not include any self-written
            methods. From now on almost every program we create during this course will include self-written
            methods.</p>

            <p>The methods are written in the program body outside the main's braces ( { and } ) but still inside
            the outermost braces, for example like this: :</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProgramBody {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
    // program code
  }

  // self-written methods
}
</pre>

            <p>Let us create a method <code>greet</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  public static void greet() {
    System.out.println("Greetings from the world of methods!");
  }
</pre>

            <p>And let us place it in the right spot.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProgramBody {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
    // program code
  }

  // self-written methods
public static void greet() {
    System.out.println("Greetings from the world of methods!");
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>In order to define a new method we need to write two things. In the first row of the method definition
            there is the method name, here it is <i>greet</i>. On the left side of the name there are definitions
            <code>public static void</code>. On the next line there is the code block, marked by the braces ({ and })
            and inside it there is the method's code, or the commands that will be executed when the method is
            called. Our method <code>greet</code> only writes one line of text to the screen.</p>

            <p>It is easy to call a self-written method. It happens by writing the method name, brackets () and a
            semicolon. In the next example main (or the main program) calls for our method, first once and then several
            times.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProgramBody {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    // program code
    System.out.println("Let us try if we can get to the method world:");
    greet();

    System.out.println("It seems like we can, let us try again:");
    greet(); 
    greet(); 
    greet();
  }

  // self-written methods
  public static void greet() {
    System.out.println("Greetings from the world of methods!");
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>When the program is executed, we see the following output::</p>

<pre>
Let us try if we can get to the method world:
Greetings from the world of methods!
It seems like we can, let us try again:
Greetings from the world of methods!
Greetings from the world of methods!
Greetings from the world of methods!
</pre>

            <p>What is noteworthy here is the execution order of the program code. The execution starts with the main
            program's (or main's) code lines, from top to bottom, one by one. When the code line to be executed
            happens to be a method call, the lines of code in the method block are executed again one by one, and when
            the method block ends the execution continues from the place where the method was called. To be exact, the
            execution continues from the next line after the original method call.</p>

            <p>To be even more exact, the main program is also a method. When the program starts, the operation system
            calls for the main method. That means that the main method is the program starting point and the execution
            starts from the first code line of main. And the program execution ends when it reaches the end of
            main.</p>

            <p>From now on when we introduce methods we will not point out that they need to be written in the right
            place inside the program code. For example, a method cannot be defined inside another method.</p>

            <div class="tehtavat">
                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3 class="req">Printing out text</h3>

                    <p>Create a method <code>printText</code> that prints the following string of characters: "In
                    the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java." and a line break.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    printText();
}

public static void printText() {
    // write your code here
}
</pre>

                    <p>The program output:</p>

<pre>
In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java.
</pre>
                </div>

                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3 class="req">Many prints</h3>

                    <p>Develop the program by adding the following feature: the main program should ask the user how
                    many times the text should be printed (meaning how many times the method is called).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ask the user how many times the text should be printed
    // use the while structure to call the printText method several times
}

public static void printText() {
    // write your code here
}
</pre>

                    <p>The program output:</p>

<pre>
How many?
<font color="red">7</font>
In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java.
In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java.
In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java.

In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java.
</pre>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> you should print the assisting question <em>How many?</em> on its own
                    line!</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Method parameters</h3>

            <p>We can make our methods more useful by giving some <em>parameters</em> to it! Parameters are variables
            that we can define in the first line of method inside the brackets, just after the method name. When the
            method is called, the parameters get their values at that point.</p>

            <p>In the next example we define a method with a parameter, its name will be <code>greet</code> and its
            parameter will be a variable of the type String called <code>name</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void greet(String name) {
  System.out.println("Hi " + name + ", greetings from the world of methods!");
}
</pre>

            <p>Let us next call the <code>greet</code> method so that on the first try we give its parameter the value
            <code>Matt</code> and on the second try <code>Arthur</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
  greet("Matt");
  greet("Arthur");
}
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Matt, greetings from the world of methods!
Hi Arthur, greetings from the world of methods!
</pre>

            <p>More complicated expressions can also be used as a parameter for our self-written methods, the same way
            we used them together with the ready-made <code>System.out.println()</code> method.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
  String name1 = "Anne";
  String name2 = "Green";
  greet( name1 + " " + name2 );

  int age = 24;
  greet("John " + age + " years");
}
</pre>

<pre>
Hi Anne Green, greetings from the world of methods!
Hi John 24 years, greetings from the world of methods!
</pre>

            <p>In both cases the method has only one parameter. The value for the parameter is calculated before
            calling the method. In the first case the parameter value comes from the String concatenation (a cool word
            that means putting the text together) <code>name1 + " " + name2</code>. The value for that
            concatenation is <i>Anne Green</i>. In the second case we get the parameter value from the String
            concatenation <code>"John " + age + " years"</code>.</p>

        <h3>Many parameters</h3>

        <p>A method can be defined to have more than one parameter. In that case the parameters are always given in the
        same order.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void greet(String name, String greetingsFrom) {
  System.out.println("Hi " + name + ", greetings from " + greetingsFrom);
}
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
String who = "Matt";
String greetings = "Alabama";

greet(who, greetings);
greet(who, greetings + " from Nevada");
</pre>

        <p>In the last <code>greet</code> function (or method) call the second parameter is formed by concatenating (or
        adding) the text “from Nevada” to the variable <code>greetings</code>. This is done before the actual function
        call.</p>

<pre>
Hi Matt, greetings from Alabama
Hi Matt, greetings from Alabama from Nevada    
</pre>

        <h3>Method calling another method</h3>

        <p>main is not the only one that is able to call methods. Methods can also call each other! Let us create a
        method <code>greetManyTimes</code> that greets the user many times using the help of the method
        <code>greet</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void greet(String name) {
  System.out.println("Hi " + name + ", greetings from the world of methods!");
}

public static void greetManyTimes(String name, int times) {
  int i = 0;
  while ( i &lt; times ) {
    greet(name);
    i++;
  }

}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  greetManyTimes("Anthony", 3);
  System.out.println("and");
  greetManyTimes("Martin", 2);
}
</pre>

        <p>Output:</p>

<pre>
Hi Anthony, greetings from the world of methods!
Hi Anthony, greetings from the world of methods!
Hi Anthony, greetings from the world of methods!
ja
Hi Martin, greetings from the world of methods!
Hi Martin, greetings from the world of methods!

                <p><b>Note:</b> you can return the exercises that contain many parts to the exercise robot even though
                you are not finished with all parts. In that case the robot complains about the tests that consider
                undone parts of the exercise, but gives you the points for all passing tests.</p>

                <h4>Printing a square</h4>

                <p>Create a method <code>printSquare(int sideSize)</code> that prints a square using our previous
                method printStars. The method call <code>printSquare(4)</code>, for example, prints the following:</p>

                <p><b>Note:</b> in order to complete the exercise it is not enough that the outprint looks good. Inside
                the printSquare method the printing needs to be done using the printStars method.</p>

                <p>When you are in the middle of making your program, you should verify the correctness of your methods
                by writing some test code into your main method.</p>

                <h4>Printing a rectangle</h4>

                <p>Create a method <code>printRectangle(int width, int height)</code> that prints a rectangle using the

                <h3 class="req">Guessing a number game</h3>

                <p>In this exercise the following game is created:</p>

<pre>
Guess a number: <font color="red">73</font>
The number is lesser, guesses made: 1
Guess a number: <font color="red">22</font>
The number is greater, guesses made: 2
Guess a number: <font color="red">51</font>
The number is greater, guesses made: 3
Guess a number: <font color="red">62</font>
The number is greater, guesses made: 4
Guess a number: <font color="red">68</font>
The number is greater, guesses made: 5
Guess a number: <font color="red">71</font>
The number is lesser, guesses made: 6
Guess a number: <font color="red">70</font>
Congratulations, your guess is correct!
</pre>

                <h4>Guessing a number</h4>

                <p>The program that comes from the exercise robot contains a command called <code>drawNumber</code>
                that draws a number that is something between 0 and 100 (and both 0 and 100 are possible). Create a
                program that draws a number and then the user has the chance to guess once what that number is. The
                program needs to print "The number is lesser", "The number is greater" or
                "Congratulations, your guess is correct!" depending on the number the user typed.</p>

<pre>
Guess a number: <font color="red">12</font>

Guess a number: <font color="red">42</font>
Congratulations, your guess is correct!
</pre>

                <h4>Repeated guessing</h4>

                <p>Develop your program by adding the following functionality: the guessing should be made repeatedly
                until the user types the right number. Note that you need to draw the number by using the
                <code>drawNumber</code> command <em>before the repetition</em>. Why? What happens if you draw the
                number inside the repetition?</p>

                <p>In the example below the command call <code>drawNumber</code> returned the value 83.</p>

Guess a number: <font color="red">55</font>
The number is greater
Guess a number: <font color="red">85</font>
The number is lesser
Guess a number: <font color="red">77</font>
The number is greater

The number is greater
Guess a number: <font color="red">83</font>
Congratulations, your guess is correct!
</pre>

                <h4>Counting the guesses</h4>

                <p>Develop your program by adding the following functionality: the program needs to include an int type
                of a variable that is used to count the guesses the user has made. The program should always print the
                number of guesses along with the answer.</p>

<pre>
Guess a number: <font color="red">55</font>
The number is greater, guesses made: 1

                <h3 class="req">A text-based user interface for the Hangman game</h3>

                <p>Your friend has programmed a Hangman game for you, but the game lacks the user inferface. The
                Hangman has the following methods:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>hangman.gameOn()</em><br>
                    Shows if the game is on</li>

                    <li><em>hangman.printStatus()</em><br>
                    Prints the game status. Shows how many guesses have been made and the letters that have not been
                    used yet.</li>

                    <li><em>hangman.printWord()</em><br>
                    Prints the word the user tries to guess. The letters that have not been guessed yet are hidden as
                    question marks, like "v?ri?ble".</li>

                    <li><em>hangman.printMan()</em><br>
                    Prints the Hangman.</li>

                    <li><em>hangman.guess(String letter)</em><br>
                    Guesses the letter that is given as a parameter.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You will get a program body from the exercise robot. It already contains some functionalities:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        Hangman hangman = new Hangman();

        System.out.println("************");
        System.out.println("* Hangman *");
        System.out.println("************");
        System.out.println("");
        printMenu();
        System.out.println("");

        // ADD YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE

    System.out.println("Thank you for playing!");
</pre>

                <p>In addition to the program body, you will get the method called <code>printMenu</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void printMenu() {
        System.out.println(" * menu *");
        System.out.println("quit   - quits the game");
        System.out.println("status  - prints the game status");
        System.out.println("a single letter uses the letter as a guess");
        System.out.println("an empty line prints this menu");
    }
</pre>

                <p>The exercise is completed in small steps.</p>

                <h4>A repetition sentence and ending the repetition</h4>

                <p>Create a repetition sentence in the program. That works as a base for the rest of the user
                interface. Ask the user to give the command inside the repetition. If the command is "quit",
                break the repetition.</p>

                <p>Use the command <code>hangman.gameOn</code> as the condition for the while structure. It means that
                the repetition should be like:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
while (hangman.gameOn()) {
  String command = reader.nextLine();
  // ...
}
</pre>

                <p>Next week we will really understand what this peculiar-looking condition is about.</p>

                <p>This far the program should have the following output:</p>

<pre>
************
* Hangman *
************

 * menu *
quit   - quits the game
status - prints the game status
a single letter uses the letter as a guess
an empty line prints this menu

Type a command: 
<font color="red">do not quit</font>

Type a command: 
<font color="red">quit</font>
Thank you for playing!
</pre>

                <h4>Printing the status</h4>

                <p>If the user gives the command "status", print the status using the method
                <code>hangman.printStatus()</code>.</p>

<pre>
************
* Hangman *
************

* menu *
quit   - quits the game
status - prints the game status
a single letter uses the letter as a guess
an empty line prints this menu

Type a command: 
<font color="red">status</font>
You have not made any guesses yet.
Unused letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Type a command: 
<font color="red">quit</font>
Thank you for playing!
</pre>

                <h4>Making a guess</h4>

                <p>If the user types in a single letter as a command, use it to make a guess. Guessing a letter happens
                with the method <code>hangman.guess(command)</code>. The guessing command has its own printing
                functionality that it uses to print more information about the guess.</p>

                <p><b>Hint:</b> finding out that the command is a single letter happens like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String command = reader.nextLine();

if(command.length() == 1) {  // command has only one letter, so it must be a guess
  hangman.guess(command);
} 
</pre>

<pre>
...
Type a command: 
<font color="red">a</font>
The letter a is not in the word.

Type a command: 
<font color="red">b</font>
The letter b is not in the word.

Type a command: 
<font color="red">c</font>
The letter c was found in the word!

Type a command: 
<font color="red">quit</font>
Thank you for playing!
</pre>

                <h4>Printing out the menu</h4>

                <p>If the user types an empty string of characters, meaning a string that has zero length, you need to
                call the method <code>printMenu</code>. Note that the method <code>printMenu</code> is not in the
                Hangman game but in your own program.</p>

                <p><b>Note:</b> checking if the string is empty happens like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String winnie = "the pooh";
if(winnie.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("String was empty");
} else {
    System.out.println("I found something!");
}
</pre>

                <h4>Printing the man and the word</h4>

                <p>If the user has not typed the command <code>quit</code>, you should call the Hangman game commands
                <code>hangman.printMan()</code> and <code>hangman.printWord()</code> at the end of the repetition.</p>

<pre>
...
Type a command: 
<font color="red">a</font>
The letter a is not in the word.

            <h2>More about methods</h2>

            <h3>Methods and the visibility of the variables</h3>

            <p>Let us try to change the value of a variable so that the variable is in the main program and the
            changing happens in a method.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
// main program
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int number = 1;
  addThree();
}

// method
public static void addThree() {
  number = number + 3;
}
</pre>

            <p>Unfortunately this program will not work, because the method cannot see the variable <code>number</code>
            in the main program.</p>

            <p>This is also the case generally, the variables from the main program are not visible for methods and the
            other way around: methods' variables are not visible for other methods or the main program. The only
            way to give information to a method from outside is to use parameters.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
// main program
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int number = 1;
  System.out.println("Main program variable number holds the value: " + number);
  addThree(number);
  System.out.println("Main program variable number holds the value: " + number);
}

// method
public static void addThree(int number) {
  System.out.println("Method parameter number holds the value: " + number);
  number = number + 3;
  System.out.println("Method parameter number holds the value: " + number);
}
</pre>

            <p>In the program above the method addThree has a parameter <code>number</code>. This parameter called
            number is <em>duplicated</em> for the method to use. When the program above is executed we see the
            following output:</p>

<pre>
Main program variable number holds the value: 1
Method parameter number holds the value: 1
Method parameter number holds the value: 4
Main program variable number holds the value:  1
</pre>

            <p>The number that we gave as a parameter to the method was <em>copied</em> for the method to use. If we
            would like to get the new value for use in our main program, the method needs to return the value.</p>

            <h3>Return values</h3>

            <p>A method can return a value. In the examples above the methods have not been returning anything. This is
            defined by writing <em>void</em> in the first line of method just before it's name.</p>

<pre class="java">
public static void addThree() {
  ...
</pre>

            <p>When defining a method that returns a value we also have to define the type of the return value. We can
            define the return value type by writing it just before the method name. Next we have a method that always
            returns the number 10 (that is of type <code>int</code>). Returning happens via the command return:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static int alwaysReturnTen() {
  return 10;
}
</pre>

            <p>We have to catch the return value and store it into a variable so that we can use it later:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int number = alwaysReturnTen();

  System.out.println( "method returned the number " + number );
}
</pre>

            <p>The method return value is assigned to a variable of <code>int</code> type just like any other integer.
            The return value can also be part of any sentence:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
double number = 4 * alwaysReturnTen() + (alwaysReturnTen() / 2) - 8;

System.out.println( "calculation total " + number );
</pre>

            <p>Every variable type we have seen this far can be used as return values:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void methodThatReturnsNothing() {
  // method body
}

public static int methodThatReturnsInteger() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}

public static String methodThatReturnsText() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}

public static double methodThatReturnsFloatingpoint() {
  // method body, needs a return statement
}
</pre>

            <p>If the method is defined to have a return value, it also has to return a value. The following method is
            wrong:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static String wrongMethod() {
  System.out.println("I tell you that I will return a String but I do not!");
}
</pre>

            <p>In the following example we define a method for calculating a sum. After that we use the method to
            calculate 2 + 7. The return value (that is returned after the method call) is assigned to a variable called
            <code>sumNumbers</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static int sum(int first, int second) {
  return first + second;
}
</pre>

            <p>Method call:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int sumNumbers = sum(2, 7);
// sumNumbers now holds the value 9
</pre>

            <p>Let us expand the example program so that the user types the numbers.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

  System.out.print("Type the first number: ");
  int first = Integer.parseInt( reader.nextLine() );

  System.out.print("Type the second number: ");
  int second = Integer.parseInt( reader.nextLine() );

  System.out.print("Total: " + sum(first,second) );
}

public static int sum(int first, int second) {
  return first + second;
}
</pre>

            <p>As we can see, the method return value does not always need to be assigned to a variable. It can also
            act as a part of the printing command just like any other int value.</p>

            <p>In the next example we call the method sum using integers that we get as return values from the method
            <code>sum</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int first = 3;
int second = 2;

sum(sum(1, 2), sum(first, second));
// 1) the inner methods are executed:
//    sum(1, 2) = 3   and sum(first, second) = 5
// 2) the outer method is executed:
//    sum(3, 5) = 8 
</pre>

            <h3>The method's own variables</h3>

            <p>The following method calculates the average of the numbers the method gets as parameters. The method
            uses helper variables <code>sum</code> and <code>average</code>. The method's own variables can be
            introduced just like any other variables.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static double average(int number1, int number2, int number3) {

  int sum = number1 + number2 + number3;
  double average = sum / 3.0;

  return average;
}
</pre>

            <div class="tehtavat">
                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3 class="req">Sum of numbers</h3>

                    <p>Create the method <code>sum</code> that calculates the sum of numbers the method receives as
                    parameters.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

                    means that the return type needs to be defined for the method and in the end the method needs to
                    return that value using a <code>return</code> command. The method does not print (or use the
                    command <code>System.out.println(..)</code>), the method caller handles printing, in this case the

            <h2 id="merkkijonot">Strings of characters</h2>

            <p>In this section we take a closer look at Java's strings of characters, which are called
            <code>Strings</code>. We have already used variables of <code>String</code> type when printing and learned
            how to compare Strings. Comparing two strings happens by <em>calling</em> the string's
            <code>equals()</code> method.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String animal = "Dog";

if( animal.equals("Dog") ) {
    System.out.println(animal + " says bow-wow");
} else if ( animal.equals("Cat") ) {
    System.out.println(cat + " says meow meow");
}
</pre>

            <p>It is possible to ask the string how many characters long it is by writing <code>.length()</code> after
            its name. In other words we are calling its method called length().</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String banana = "banana";
String cucumber = "cucumber";
String together = banana + cucumber;

System.out.println("The length of banana is " + banana.length());
System.out.println("The length of  cucumber is " + cucumber.length());
System.out.println("The word " + together + " length is " + together.length());
</pre>

            <p>In the above code the method <code>length()</code> is called for three different strings. The call
            <code>banana.length()</code> calls only the method that gives the length of the string <code>banana</code>,
            while <code>cucumber.length()</code> calls the method that gives the length of the string
            <code>cucumber</code> etc. The left part before the dot says whose method is called.</p>

            <p>Java has a special data type called <code>char</code> to be used for characters. A <code>char</code>
            variable can store one character. A string variable can give its characters by location when the
            <code>charAt()</code> method is used. Note that counting the characters starts from zero!</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String word = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";

char character = word.charAt(3);
System.out.println("The 4th character of the word is " + character); //prints "e"
</pre>

            <p>The characters in a string are numbered (ot more technically speaking strings are indexed) starting from
            0. Because of that we can reach the last character in a string from the number (or index) "the length
            of the word minus one", or <code>word.charAt(word.length()-1)</code>. The following example will make
            the program crash, because we are trying to get a character from an index that does not exist.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
char character = word.charAt(word.length());
</pre>

                        name arises. In NetBeans it is really easy to rename things. Just select and "paint"
                        the name you want to change with the mouse. Then press ctrl and r simultaneously, then write
                        the new name.</p>

            <h3 id="merkkijonon_muita">Other methods for strings</h3>

            <p>In many cases we want to read only a specific part of a string. A method in the String class called
            <code>substring</code> makes this possible. It can be used in two ways:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String word = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
System.out.println(word.substring(14)); //prints "listicexpialidocious"
System.out.println(word.substring(9,20)); //prints "fragilistic"
</pre>

            <p>We can store the return value in a variable, because the return value of the <code>substring</code>
            method is of <code>String</code> type.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String book = "Mary Poppins";
String endpart = book.substring(5);
System.out.println("Harry " + endpart); // prints "Harry Poppins"
</pre>

            <p>Methods in the String class also make it possible to search for a specific word in the text. For
            example, the word "or" can be found in the word "Horse". A method called
            <code>indexOf()</code> searches for the word given as a parameter in a string. If the word is found, it
            returns the starting index (or the place, remember that the numbering starts from 0!) of the word. If the
            word is not found, the method returns the value -1.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String word = "aesthetically";

int index = word.indexOf("tic"); // index value will be 6
System.out.println(word.substring(index)); //prints "tically"

index = word.indexOf("ally"); //index value will be 9
System.out.println(word.substring(index)); //prints "ally"

index = word.indexOf("book"); // string "aesthetically" does not include "book" 
System.out.println(index); //prints -1

                    <p><b>Hint:</b> you probably need to build the reversed string character by character in your
                    method. You can use a String-type variable as a helper during the building. In the beginning the
                    helper variable should have an empty string of characters as a value. After this, new characters
                    are added to the string one by one.</p>

<pre>
  String help = "";

  // ...
  // adding a character to the help variable
  help = help + character;

            <h2>Object</h2>

            <p>Strings and integers for example have some differences. Integers are "just values", they can
            be used in calculations and they can be printed to the screen:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int x = 1;
int y = 3;

y = 3*x + t;

System.out.println( "value of y now: " + y );
</pre>

            <p>Strings are a bit "cleverer" and they know how long they are for example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String word1 = "Programming";
String word2 = "Java";

System.out.println( "String "+ word1 +" length: " + word1.length() );

System.out.println( "String "+ word2 +" length: " + word2.length() );

</pre>

            <p>Program output:</p>

<pre>
String Programming length: 11
String Java length: 4
</pre>

            <p>We can determine the length by calling the String method <code>length()</code>. Strings have other
            methods as well. Integers (or whole numbers, variables of type <code>int</code>) have no methods at all.
            They do not "know" anything.</p>

            <p>Strings are <em>objects</em>, or "something that has methods and a value". Later we will see
            many other objects as well.</p>

            <p>As we can see in the previous example, an object's methods are called by adding a dot and a method
            call after the object name:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
word1.length()    // String object name is word1 and its method length() is called
word2.length()    // String object name is word2 and its method length() is called
</pre>

            <p>The method call is made explicitly to the object. In the above example we have two objects and first we
            call the <code>length()</code> method of the String object <code>word1</code> and then do the same for the
            object <code>word2</code>.</p>

            <p>Our old friend <code>reader</code> is also an object:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
</pre>Even though readers and strings are both objects, they are not very similar. Readers (Scanners) have the <code>
            nextLine()</code> method, for example, but Strings do not. In the Java language the objects need to be
            "born", in other words created with the <code>new</code> command. Strings are objects that make
            an exception to that rule! --There are two ways to create a String object:

<pre class="sh_java">
String banana = new String("Banana");
String carrot = "carrot";
</pre>

            <p>Both of the commands above create a new String object. Using the <code>new</code> command when creating
            String objects is rare.</p>

            <p>The object "type" is called a <em>class</em>. The class of character strings is called
            <code>String</code> and the class of readers is called <code>Scanner</code>. Later we learn much more about
            classes and objects.</p>

            <h2>ArrayList or an "object container"</h2>

            <p>It often happens during programming that we would like to keep for example many different strings in the
            memory. A very bad idea would be to define a variable for each of them: :</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String word1;
String word2;
String word3;
// ...
String word10;
</pre>

            <p>This would be a good-for-nothing solution and the reasons for it do not even need justification --think
            about this approach and make the word count to be a hundred or even a thousand!</p>

            <p>Just like other modern programming languages, Java gives us different tools to keep many objects neatly
            in our program. Now we take a closer look at <em>ArrayList</em>, which is probably the most used object
            container in Java.</p>

            <p>The following lines of code take into use an ArrayList that specifically holds objects of String type.
            Then a couple of strings are stored into the list.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ListProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; wordList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        wordList.add("First");
        wordList.add("Second");
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>In the above main program method the first row creates a new ArrayList called <code>wordList</code> that
            can be used as a container for String variables. The type of the ArrayList is
            <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>, which means the ArrayList is specifically for storing Strings. The
            list is created using the command <code>new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</code>.</p>

            <p><b>Note:</b> for getting the ArrayList working, the program needs to have it imported. That happens by
            writing at the beginning of the program either <code>import java.util.ArrayList;</code> or <code>import
            java.util.*;</code></p>

            <p>When the list is created, two strings are added by calling the list method <code>add</code>. The list
            will not run out of space, so theoretically the list can contain any number of Strings (as long as they fit
            in the "machines" memory.</p>

            <p>Internally an ArrayList is -- as its name suggests -- a list. The added strings automatically go to the
            end of the ArrayList.</p>

            <h3>ArrayList methods</h3>

            <p>ArrayList provides us with many useful methods:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        teachers.add("Anthony");
        teachers.add("Barto");
        teachers.add("Paul");
        teachers.add("John");
        teachers.add("Martin");
        teachers.add("Matt");

        System.out.println("the number of teachers " + teachers.size() );

        System.out.println("first teacher on the list " + teachers.get(0));
        System.out.println("third teacher on the list " + teachers.get(2));

        teachers.remove("Barto");

        if ( teachers.contains("Barto") ) {
            System.out.println("Barto is on the teachers list");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Barto is not on the teachers list");
        }
    }
</pre>

            <p>First a string list is created and then 6 names added to it. <code>size</code> tells us the amount of
            strings on the list. <b>Note:</b> when the method is called, the call should have the following formatting:
            <code>teachers.size()</code>. First comes the object name, then follows a dot and after that comes the
            method name.</p>

            <p>The strings will be on the list in the order in which they were added to it. With the method
            <code>get(i)</code> we get the value from the index (place) i on the list. The list items indexing (place
            numbering) starts from 0. That means the first added string will be found at the index 0, second at the
            index 1 and so on.</p>

            <p>We can remove strings from the list using the method <code>remove</code>. The method can be used in two
            ways. The first way, <code>remove("characters")</code> removes the string of characters given as
            a parameter. The second way, <code>remove(3)</code> removes the 4th String from the list.</p>

            <p>At the end of the example the method <code>contains</code> is called. That method is used for asking the
            list if it contains the string of characters given as a parameter. If it does, the method returns the value
            <code>true</code>.</p>

            <p>Program output:</p>

<pre>
the number of teachers 6
first teacher on the list Anthony
third teacher on the list Paul
Barto is not on the teachers list
</pre>

            <p><strong>Note!</strong> Methods <code>remove</code> and <code>contains</code> assume that the objects
            stored in the ArrayList do have an <code>equals</code> method. We will get back to this later in the
            course.</p>

            <h3>Going through an ArrayList</h3>

            <p>In the following example 4 names are added to the list and then the whole list is printed:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        teachers.add("Anthony");
        teachers.add("Paul");
        teachers.add("John");
        teachers.add("Martin");

        System.out.println( teachers.get(0) );
        System.out.println( teachers.get(1) );
        System.out.println( teachers.get(2) );
        System.out.println( teachers.get(3) );
}
</pre>

            <p>This solution works, but is really clumsy. What if there were more items on the list? Or less? What if
            we would not know how many items there are?</p>

            <p>First we create a temporary version:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        teachers.add("Anthony");
        teachers.add("Paul");
        teachers.add("John");
        teachers.add("Martin");
        teachers.add("Matt");

        int place = 0;
        System.out.println( teachers.get(place) );
        place++;  
        System.out.println( teachers.get(place) );  // place = 1
        place++;
        System.out.println( teachers.get(place) );  // place = 2
        place++;
        System.out.println( teachers.get(place) );  // place = 3
}
</pre>

            <p>Using our old friend the <code>while</code> command we can increment the variable <code>place</code> by
            one until it gets too big:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        teachers.add("Anthony");
        teachers.add("Paul");
        teachers.add("John");
        teachers.add("Martin");
        teachers.add("Matt");

        int place = 0;
        while ( place &lt; teachers.size() )  // do you remember why place &lt;= teachers.size() does not work?
            System.out.println( teachers.get(place) );
            place++;
        }
}
</pre>

            <p>Now the printing works regardless of the number of items on the list.</p>

            <p>Using a while repetition sentence and "self indexing" the list places is not usually the best
            way to go through a list. A much more recommendable way is to use the for-each repetition described
            below.</p>

            <h3>for-each</h3>

            <p>Even though usually the command is referred to as for-each, the real name of the command is only
            <code>for</code>. There are two versions of for, the traditional and the "for-each". The later is
            used now.</p>

            <p>Going through ArrayList items with for-each is like child's play:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        teachers.add("Anthony");
        teachers.add("Paul");
        teachers.add("John");
        teachers.add("Martin");
        teachers.add("Matt");

        for (String teacher : teachers) {
            System.out.println( teacher );
        }
}
</pre>

            <p>As we can see, the list indexes can be ignored if we go through the list content
            "automatically".</p>

            <p>In the code block of the for command (inside { }) a variable <code>teacher</code> is used. It is defined
            in the for row, on the left side of the colon. What happens there is that every item on the list
            <code>teachers</code> becomes the value of the variable <code>teacher</code>, one by one. It means that
            when for is entered, the first <code>teacher</code> is <em>Anthony</em>, second execution of for makes the
            <code>teacher</code> be <em>Paul</em> etc.</p>

            <p>Even though the <code>for</code> command might seem a bit strange at first, you should definitely get
            used to using it!</p>

            ArrayList is defined:</p>

            <p>The program now includes two lists, <em>programmingLanguages</em> and <em>countries</em>. First the

            refers to the list given as a parameter with the name <em>printed</em>! Next the printing method is given
            the list <em>countries</em>. Now again the method uses the name <em>printed</em> referring to the parameter
            list.</p>

                <p>As we can tell from the example above, an ArrayList can be printed as it is. The print formatting is
                not usually what is sought after and we are forced to handle the printing ourself with the help of the
                <code>for</code> command, for example.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Numbers in an ArrayList</h3>

            <p>ArrayLists can be used to store any type of values. If the stored variables are of integer type, there
            are a couple of details to remember. An integer ArrayList is defined like this:
            <code>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, instead of writing <code>int</code> you must write
            <code>Integer</code>.</p>

            <p>The method <code>remove</code> does not work like expected when the list consists of <code>int</code>
            numbers::</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 

        numbers.add(4); 
        numbers.add(8); 

        // tries to remove the number from the index 4, does not work as expected!
        numbers.remove(4); 

        // this removes the number 4 from the list
        numbers.remove( Integer.valueOf(4) ); 
</pre>

            <p><code>numbers.remove(4)</code> tries to remove the item in the index 4 from the list. There are only 2
            items on the list, so that the command results in an error. We must use a slightly more complicated form if
            the number 4 needs to be removed: <code>numbers.remove( Integer.valueOf(4) );</code></p>

            <p>ArrayLists can also be used to store <code>double</code>s (i.e. decimal numbers) and characters (i.e.
            <code>char</code> variables). The lists can be defined like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
        ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; doubles = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;(); 
        ArrayList&lt;Character&gt; characters = new ArrayList&lt;Character&gt;();

            <p>ArrayList can also be returned from a method as a return value. In the next example a method creates an
            ArrayList, adds three integers in the list and then returns the list. Pay attention to how the main program
            assigns the list returned by the method as a value into a variable that has the same type as the return
            value list:</p>

                <p>Create the method <code>variance</code> that gets a list of integers as a parameter and then returns
                the sample variance of that list. You can check how a sample variance is calculated in <a href=
                "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Population_variance_and_sample_variance">Wikipedia</a>, under
                "Population variance and sample variance".</p>

                <p><b>Note:</b> the metod should use the method <code>average</code> of exercise 64 to calculate the
                average of the parameters. The method should be called only once!</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static double variance(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) { 
    // write your code here
} 

public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();

                <p>Program output:</p>

<pre>
 
The variance is: 5.666667 
</pre>

                <p>(The average of the numbers is 3.5, so the sample variance is ((3 - 3.5)² + (2 - 3.5)² + (7 - 3.5)²
                + (2 - 3.5)²)/(4 - 1) ≈ 5,666667.)</p>

                <p><strong>Note!</strong> Remember while testing your program that a sample variance for a list that
                contains only one item is not defined! Then a division by zero happens in the formula. Java considers
                the result of division by zero a <em>Not a Number</em> (<code>NaN</code>).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Using truth values</h2>

        <p>A variable of truth value type (i.e. <code>boolean</code> can only have two values: <em>true</em> or
        <em>false</em>. Here is an example on how to use boolean variables:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
        int num1 = 1; 
        int num2 = 5; 

        boolean firstGreater = true; 

        if (num1 &lt;= num2) { 
            firstGreater = false; 
        } 

        if (firstGreater==true) { 
            System.out.println("num1 is greater"); 
        } else { 
            System.out.println("num1 was not greater"); 
        } 
</pre>

        <p>First we assign the truth value variable <code>firstGreater</code> the value <em>true</em>. The first if
        sentence checks whether <code>num1</code> is less or equal to <code>num2</code>. If it is, we change the value
        of firstGreater to be <em>false</em>. The later if sentence selects what it prints based on the truth
        value.</p>

        <p>As a matter of fact using a truth value in a conditional sentence is easier than described in the previous
        example. We can also write the second if sentence like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
        if (firstGreater) {  // means the same as firstGreater==true 
            System.out.println("num1 was greater"); 
        } else { 
            System.out.println("num1 was not greater"); 
        } 
</pre>

        <p>If we want to check if the boolean variable holds the value true, we do not need to write
        <code>==true</code>, writing just the name of the variable is enough!</p>

        <p>If we want to check if the boolean variable holds the value false, we can check that using a negation
        operation (i.e. an exclamation mark:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
        if (!firstGreater) {  // means the same as firstGreater==false 
            System.out.println("num1 was not greater"); 
        } else { 
            System.out.println("num1 was greater"); 
        } 
</pre>

        <h3>A method that returns a truth value</h3>

        <p>Truth values come in especially handy when we want to write methods that check for validity. Let us create a
        method that checks if the list it gets as a parameter includes only positive numbers (here 0 is considered
        positive). The method returns the information as a boolean (i.e. truth value).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static boolean allPositive(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers) { 
        boolean noNegative = true; 

        for (int number : numbers) { 
            if (number &lt; 0) { 
                noNegative = false; 
            } 
        } 

        // if one of the numbers on the list had a value that was under 0, noNegatives becomes false.

        return noNegative; 
    } 
</pre>

        <p>The method has a boolean helper variable called <code>noNegative</code>. First we assign the helper variable
        the value true. The method checks all numbers on the list one by one. If at least one number is less than 0, we
        assign the helper variable the value false. In the end the method returns the value of the helper variable. If
        no negative numbers were found, it has the value true, otherwise it has the value false.</p>

        <p>The method is used like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 
        numbers.add(3); 
        numbers.add(1); 
        numbers.add(-1); 

        boolean result = allPositive(numbers); 

        if (result) {  // means the same as result == true 
            System.out.println("all numbers are positive"); 
        } else { 
            System.out.println("there is at least one negative number"); 
        } 
    } 
</pre>

        <p>Usually it is not necessary to store the answer into a variable. We can write the method call directly as
        the condition:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 
        numbers.add(4); 
        numbers.add(7); 
        numbers.add(12); 
        numbers.add(9); 

        if (allPositive(numbers)) { 
            System.out.println("all numbers are positive"); 
        } else { 
            System.out.println("there is at least one negative number"); 
        } 
    } 
</pre>

        <h3>The command return and the ending of a method</h3>

        <p>The execution of a method is stopped immediately when a command called <code>return</code> is executed.
        Using that information to our advantage we can write the <code>allPositive</code> method a bit more
        clearly.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static boolean allPositive(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers) { 
        for (int number : numbers) { 
            if (number &lt; 0) { 
                return false; 
            } 
        } 

        // if the execution reached this far, no negative numbers were found
        // so we return true
        return true; 
    } 
} 
</pre>

        <p>When we are going through the list of numbers and we find a negative number, we can exit the method by
        returning false. If there are no negative numbers on the list, we get to the end and therefore can return true.
        We have now gotten rid of the helper variable inside the method!</p>

                <h2>Methods and the copying of parameters</h2>

                <p>Let us focus on a couple of details concerning methods.</p>

                <p>In section 15 there was an example, in which we tried to change the value of a main program variable
                inside a method.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
  int number = 1; 
  addThree(); 
  System.out.println("Main program variable number holds the value: " + number); 
} 

public static void addThree() { 
  number = number + 3; 
} 
</pre>

                <p>This program of ours does not work, because the method cannot access the main program variable
                <code>number</code>.</p>

                <p>That is because main program variables are not visible to the methods. And more generally: no method
                variable is visible to other methods. Because the main program <code>main</code> is also a method, this
                holds for the main program as well. The only way to give information to a method is to use
                parameters.</p>

                <p>Let us try to fix the above example by passing the main program variable <code>number</code> to the
                method as a parameter.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
  int number = 1; 
  addThree(number); 
  System.out.println(number);  // prints 1, the value did not change
} 

public static addThree(int number) { 
  number = number + 3; 
} 
</pre>

                <p>The program still does not work the way we want. The method parameters are different variables than
                the ones introduced in the main program. In the previous example the method increments a variable with
                the same name as the main program variable. The parameter has the same name, but is not the same as the
                main program variable <code>number</code>.</p>

                <p>When a parameter is given to a method, the value of the parameter <em>is copied into a new
                variable</em> and that new variable is the one the method uses. In the example above the variable
                <code>number</code> that was given to the method <code>addThree</code> as a parameter will be copied
                and then the copy is actually handed out to the method to use. The method uses only a copy of the
                variable from the main program, not the original variable. The main program variable
                <code>number</code> stays unchanged.</p>

                <p>We can imagine that the main program method <code>main</code> and the method <code>addThree</code>
                both work in their own parts of the computer memory. In the picture below there is a "box"
                for the value of the variable <code>number</code> of the main method. When the method is called, a new
                "box" named <code>number</code> will be created and the main method variable
                <code>number</code>'s value will be copied into it. In this example the number is 1. Both variables
                that are called <code>number</code> are separate, therefore when the method <code>addThree</code>
                changes the value of its own variable called <code>number</code> it does not affect the variable
                <code>number</code> in the main program.</p>

                <p>The picture below will demonstrate what happens.</p>

                <p><img src="img/metodi1.png"></p>

                <p>The method can still naturally pass information to the caller, that happens by using a return value
                (i.e. using a <code>return</code> command to return a variable with a value). We can get the previous
                example to work by changing the code a little bit:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
  int number = 1; 
  number = addThreeAndReturn(number); 

  System.out.println(number);  // prints 4, because number has the method return value as its value        
} 

public static int addThreeAndReturn(int number) { 
  number = number + 3; 

  return number; 
} 
</pre>

                <p>The method still uses the copy of the main program variable <code>number</code>. In the main program
                we assign the variable <code>number</code> the method return value as a new value, so that we can get
                the change to take effect in the main program. Note that the name of the method variable plays no role
                here. The code works exactly the same regardless of the names. Here follows an example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
  int number = 1; 
  number = addThreeAndReturn(number); 

  System.out.println(number);            
} 

public static int addThreeAndReturn(int incremented) { 
  incremented = incremented + 3; 

  return incremented; 
} 
</pre>

                <p>We found out that the parameters in methods are different variables than the variables introduced in
                the method call. Only the parameter value gets copied from the caller to the method.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately it is not that simple. If a method gets an <code>ArrayList</code> as a parameter, the
                method sees the original list and all the changes the method makes will take effect everywhere.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static void removeFirst(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) { 
        list.remove(0); // removes the number from index 0
    }  
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 
    numbers.add(4); 
    numbers.add(3); 
    numbers.add(7); 
    numbers.add(3); 

    System.out.println(numbers); // prints [4,3,7,3] 

    removeFirst(numbers); 

    System.out.println(numbers); // prints [3,7,3] 
</pre>

                <p>Unlike a parameter of <code>int</code> type, a list will not be copied and therefore the method
                makes changes to the original list given as a parameter.</p>

                <p>The picture below will clarify the example. <code>ArrayList</code> does not live in an imagined
                "box" like an <code>int</code>. The variable name in the example <code>numbers</code> is only
                a <em>reference</em> that refers to the place where the ArrayList is. One way to visualize this is that
                an <code>ArrayList</code> is connected with a wire. The name of the <code>ArrayList</code> is a
                "wire", and the list itself is located "in the other end of the wire". When we give
                the <code>ArrayList</code> to a method as a parameter we actually give the method a wire, and when the
                method uses its parameter it finds the original list at the other end of it. Actually the main program
                and the method do have separate wires, but both wires have the same original list at the end of them
                and all the changes will be made directly to the original list. During and after this week we will find
                out that many things in Java are "connected with a wire".</p>

                <p><img src="img/metodi-lanka.PNG" height="400"></p>

                <p>Note that again the parameter name inside the method can be anything. It does not need to be the
                same as the name in the main program (or other method that calls it). In the example above the method
                uses the name <code>list</code> but the method caller sees the same list with a different name,
                <code>numbers</code>.</p>

                <p>But why does the value of the parameter get copied and the original variable stay intact when the
                parameter is of <code>int</code> type but the original list is given to the method when the parameter
                is of <code>ArrayList</code> type? In Java only the values of <strong><em>primitive data
                types</em></strong> (which are <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>char</code>,
                <code>boolean</code> and a couple of others that we have not yet discussed) get copied to the method.
                When the method parameters are of other types only the <em>references</em> are copied to the method. A
                reference is like a "wire", therefore the method can access the list using it directly. The
                variables that are not of primitive data types are of <strong><em>reference data types</em></strong>
                and are "wired" just like the ArrayList in the previous example. The method is given to the
                wire and the method can access the parameter directly.</p>

                        anything and the same item can appear on the list more than once. An example on using the
                        method:</p>

                <h2>Instructions on code-writing and problem solving</h2>

                <p>One of the leading software developers, <em>Kent Beck</em>, has said:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code
                    that humans can understand."</em></li>

                    <li><em>"I'm not a great programmer, I'm just good programmer with great
                    habits."</em></li>
                </ul>

                <p>We are now, at the latest, taking the first steps towards that goal.</p>

                <h3>Well indented and "breathing" code</h3>

                <p>Let us take a look at a code that first adds numbers to a list and then prints the list items. After
                that all instances of a certain number are removed from the list and the list gets printed.</p>

                <p>First we write the code badly and without indentations:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 
numbers.add(4); 
numbers.add(3); 
numbers.add(7); 
numbers.add(3); 
System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:"); 
for (int number : numbers) { 
System.out.println(number); 
} 
while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) { 
numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3)); 
} 
System.out.println("The numbers after removal:"); 
for (int number : numbers) { 
System.out.println(number); 
} 
</pre>

                <p>Even though the unindented code works, it is unpleasant to read. Let us indent the code (you can get
                NetBeans to auto-indent your code by pressing alt+shift+f) and separate logical parts with line
                breaks:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); 
        numbers.add(4); 
        numbers.add(3); 
        numbers.add(7); 
        numbers.add(3); 

        System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:"); 

        // here we print numbers 
        for (int number : numbers) { 
            System.out.println(number); 
        } 

        // checks if the list contains the number 3 
        while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) { 
            numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));  // if yes, it is removed
        } 
        // we use a while structure to get all the threes removed!

        System.out.println("The numbers after removal:"); 

         // here we print numbers
        for (int number : numbers) { 
            System.out.println(number); 
        } 
</pre>

                <p>Now the code starts to make sense. For example, the printing and the number removal are two logical
                parts, therefore they are separated with line breaks. The code is <em>airy</em> and reading the code is
                much more pleasant.</p>

                <p>There are even comments in the code to help the reader understand what happens where!</p>

                <h3>Getting rid of copy-paste with methods</h3>

                <p>The original sin of a programmer is to create copy-paste code, which means using the same code in
                multiple places by copy-pasting it around. In our example the printing of the list is done twice. The
                code that handles the printing part should be separated as its own method and then call the method from
                the main program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
        numbers.add(4);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(7);
        numbers.add(3);

        System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");

        // here we print numbers
        print(numbers);

        while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(3))) {
            numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));
        }

        System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");

        // here we print numbers
        print(numbers);
    }

    public static void print(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers) {
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println( number );
        }
    }
</pre>

                <h3>Slicing separate tasks into methods with descriptive names</h3>

                <p>The code has become even more easy to read. A distinctively separate entity, the printing of the
                list is now a method that is easy to understand. By defining a new method the readability of the main
                program has improved. Pay attention to the descriptive name of the method: the name says exactly what
                the method does. Next we can remove the advising comments <em>here we print numbers</em> , because the
                method name speaks for itself.</p>

                <p>There is still room for improvements in the program. The main program still looks a bit messy, since
                there is an "unaesthetic" code line that directly manipulates the list, in between the neat
                method calls. Let us turn also that unaesthetic piece of code into a method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
        numbers.add(4);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(7);
        numbers.add(3);

        System.out.println("The numbers in the beginning:");
        print(numbers);

        remove(numbers, 3);

        System.out.println("The numbers after removal:");
        print(numbers);
    }

    public static void print(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers) {
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println( number );
        }
    }

    public static void remove(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int removed) {
        while (numbers.contains(Integer.valueOf(removed))) {
            numbers.remove(Integer.valueOf(removed));
        }
    }
</pre>

                <p>In the example above we created a new descriptively named method out of a separate logical entity,
                i.e. removing all the instances of a certain number. The resulting main program is now very
                understandable - almost like natural language. Both methods are very simple and easy to understand as
                well.</p>

                <p>Kent Beck might be proud of what we have accomplished. The code is easy to understand, easy to
                modify and does not include any copy-paste.</p><!--

      <li><code>public static void reset(Scanner reader, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines)</code></li>
      <li><code>public static void remove(Scanner reader, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines)</code></li>
      <li><code>public static void add(Scanner reader, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines)</code></li>
      <li><code>public static void count(Scanner reader, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines)</code></li>
    </ul>
  <p>After the methods are finished you should change the main method code so that it uses the newly-created methods to implement the commands. The new main method should only ask the name of the command from the user and then call the right method (from the list above) to do the work. The program should work like the original did regardless of the cleanup!</p>

  <h4>Reading the line number</h4>

  <p>After the now taken measures the code still has some repetition left, the reading of the line numbers. Create the method <code>public static int askLineNumber(String question,
 Scanner reader)</code>. This method prints the question and reads the line number. Return value is -1 if the user entered a blank line (i.e. just pressed enter).</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> you can use the following method body:</p>


<pre class="sh_java">
    public static int askLineNumber(String question, Scanner reader) {
        System.out.println(question);
        String line = // read a line from the user

        // if the line was empty, -1 gets returned;
        if (line.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }

        // otherwise turn the line variable into an integer using Integer.parseint and return that
        return ...
    }
</pre>

  <h4>Call the method <code>askLineNumber</code> from the method <code>remove</code></h4>

  <p>The method <code>remove</code> reads a line number from the user.
Change the <code>remove</code> method to use the <code>askLineNumber</code> method you just created.</p>

  <h4>Call the <code>askLineNumber</code> method from the method <code>add</code></h4>

  <p>The method <code>add</code> reads a line number from the user as well.
Use the <code>askLineNumber</code> method to read the line number.</p>

  <h3>The least common multiple</h3>

  <p>In this assignment the least common multiple of two numbers is calculated using their greatest common divisor. </p>

  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple">The least common multiple</a> is the smallest whole number that is exactly divisible (i.e. remainder is 0) by the numbers in question. It can be calculated easily, if we know the greatest common divisor of the numbers. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">The greatest common divisor</a> means the greatest number that divides the numbers in question so that the result is a whole number.</p>

  <p>For example, the greatest common divisor of the numbers 32 and 6 is 2, because 32 / 2 = 16 and 6 / 2 = 3 and there is no greater number that those two numbers could be exactly divided with.</p>

  <p>The least common multiple of the numbers 32 and 6 is 96, because 96 / 32 = 3 ja 96 / 6 = 16, and there is no smaller number that those two numbers could be exactly divided with.</p>

  <h4>Calculating the greatest common divisor</h4>

  <p>Create the method <code>public static int greatestCommonDivisor(int number1, int number2)</code> into the class <code>LeastCommonMultiple</code>. The method calculates the greatest common divisor of the two numbers it gets as parameters and retuns the resulting number.</p>

                <h2 id="olio_ohjelmointi">Object-oriented programming</h2>

                <p>Before we begin, here's a little intro to object-oriented programming.</p>

                <p>In procedural programming - which is the way of programming we've been studying so far - a
                program is divided in to smaller parts, methods. A method works as a separate part of a program and it
                can be called from anywhere in the program. When a method is called, execution of the program moves to
                the beginning of the called method. After execution of the method is done, the program will continue
                from where the method was called.</p>

                <p>In object oriented programming, just like in procedural programming, we attempt to divide a program
                into smaller parts. In object-oriented programming the small parts are objects. Each separate object
                has its own individual responsibility; an object contains a related group of information and
                functionality. Object-oriented programs consist of multiple objects which together define how the
                program works.</p>

                <h3>Object</h3>

                <p>We've used many of the ready-made objects in Java already. For example, <code>ArrayLists</code>
                are objects. Each separate list consists of information related to it; that is, <i>the state of the
                object</i>. Functionality is also contained in the list objects: the methods by which the state of the
                object can be altered. As an example there's two ArrayList objects in the following piece of code,
                cities and <code>countries</code> :</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; cities = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; countries = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        countries.add("Finland");
        countries.add("Germany");
        countries.add("Netherlands");

        cities.add("Berliini");
        cities.add("Nijmegen");
        cities.add("Turku");
        cities.add("Helsinki");

        System.out.println("number of countries " + countries.size() );
        System.out.println("number of cities " + cities.size() );
    }
</pre>

                <p>Both the <code>countries</code> object and the <code>cities</code> object live a life of their own.
                The state of each is not related to the state of the other. For example, the state of the
                <code>countries</code> object consists of the Strings "Finland", "Germany" and
                "Netherlands" that are on the list, probably also the information of how many countries are
                in the list.</p>

                <p>When doing a method call related to an object (for example,
                <code>countries.add("Finland");</code>), the name of the object whose method is being called
                goes to the left side of the period and to the right side goes the name of the method itself. When
                asking how many Strings the <code>countries</code> list has we will call countries.size(), so we are
                calling the method <code>size</code> of the object <code>countries</code>. What the method returns
                depends on the state of the object in question, other objects don't affect the execution of the
                method in any way.</p>

                <p>We've used the command <code>new</code> many times already. For example the creation of a list
                (<code>ArrayList</code>) and the creation of a reader (<code>Scanner</code>) have happened with the
                command <code>new</code>. The reason is that both of these are <em>classes</em> from which the object
                is created. in Java, objects are always created with <code>new</code>, except in a few cases.</p>

                <p>One of the cases where you don't always need to use <code>new</code> is in the construction of
                Strings. The familiar way to create a String is actually an abbreviated way of using <code>new</code>.
                A String can also be created with new just like any other object:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
        String text = "some text";       // abbreviated way of creating a String
        String anotherText = new String("more text");  
</pre>

                <p>Cases in which Java's ready-made parts call <code>new</code> out of sight of the programmer also
                exist.</p>

                <h3>Class</h3>

                <p>It is clear that all objects aren't similar to one another. For example, <code>ArrayList</code>
                objects differ drastically from <code>String</code> objects. All <code>ArrayList</code>s have the same
                methods code&gt;add, <code>contains</code>, <code>remove</code>, <code>size</code>, ... and
                respectively all <code>String</code> objects have the same methods (<code>substring</code>,
                <code>length</code>, <code>charAt</code>, ...). Arraylist and String objects don't have the same
                methods because they're different types of objects.</p>

                <p>The type of a certain group of objects is called a <strong>class</strong>. <code>ArrayList</code> is
                a class, so are <code>String</code>, <code>Scanner</code>, and so forth. Objects on the other hand are
                <em>instances</em> of classes.</p>

                <p>Objects of the same class all have the same methods and a similar state. For example, the state of
                an <code>ArrayList</code> object consists of elements inserted to the list while the state of a
                <code>String</code> object consists of a string of characters.</p>

                <h3>Class and its objects</h3>

                <p><b>Class defines</b> what kind of objects it has:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>what methods the object has</b></li>

                    <li><b>what the state of the object is, or in other words, what kind of attributes the object
                    has</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>A class describes the "blueprint" of the objects that are made out of it.</p>

                <p>Lets take an analogy from the world outside of computers: the blueprints of a house. The blueprints
                define how the building is to be built and in that way dictate the shape and size of it. The blueprints
                are the class, they define the general characteristics of the objects created out of that class:</p>

                <p><img src="img/luokka.jpg"></p>

                <p>Individual objects, the houses in our analogy, are made from that same blueprint. They are instances
                of the same class. The state of individual objects, the attributes, can vary (color of the walls, the
                building material of the roof, doors, windowsills, etc...). Here's one instance of a House
                object:</p>

                <p><img src="img/olio.jpg" height="250"></p>

                <p>An object is always created from its class by calling the method - the <em>constructor</em> - that
                creates the object with the command <code>new</code>. For example, a new instance is created from the
                class Scanner by calling <code>new Scanner(..)</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
</pre>

                <p>Constructors take parameters the way any other method does.</p>

                <div class="tehtavat">
                    <div class="tehtava">
                        <h3>Accounts</h3>

                        <p>You get a ready-made class <code>Account</code> along with your exercise files. The object
                        of the class <code>Account</code> represents a bank account, which has a balance (meaning some
                        amount of money). The accounts are used like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
Account bartosAccount = new Account("Barto's account",100.00);
Account bartosSwissAccount = new Account("Barto's account in Switzerland",1000000.00);

System.out.println("Initial state");
System.out.println(bartosAccount);
System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);

bartosAccount.withdrawal(20);
System.out.println("Barto's account balance is now: "+bartosAccount.balance());
bartosSwissAccount.deposit(200);
System.out.println("Barto's Swiss account balance is now: "+bartosSwissAccount.balance());

System.out.println("Final state");
System.out.println(bartosAccount);
System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);
</pre>

                        <h4>Your first account</h4>

                        <p><b>Note:</b> there is a different exercise template for each of the sub-exercises.
                        For this exercise use the template 072.1</p>

                        <p>Create a program that creates an account with the balance of 100.0, deposits 20.0 and prints
                        the account. <strong>Note!</strong> do all the steps described in the exercise exactly in the
                        described order!</p>

                        <h4>Your first money transfer</h4>

                        <p><b>Note:</b> there is a different exercise template for each of the sub-exercises.
                        For this exercise use the template 072.2</p>

                        <p>Create a program that:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Creates an account named <code>"Matt's account"</code> with the balance
                            of 1000</li>

                            <li>Creates an account named <code>"My account"</code> with the balance of 0</li>

                            <li>Withdraws 100.0 from Matt's account</li>

                            <li>Deposits 100.0 to My account</li>

                            <li>Prints both accounts</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Money transfers</h4>

                        <p><b>Note:</b> there is a different exercise template for each of the sub-exercises.
                        For this exercise use the template 072.3</p>

                        <p>In the above program you made a money transfer from one person to another. Let us next
                        create a method that does the same!</p>

                        <p>Create the method <code>public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, double
                        howMuch)</code> in the given program body. The method transfers money from one account to
                        another. You do not need to check that the <code>from</code> account has enough balance.</p>

                        <p>After doing that make sure that your <code>main</code> method does the following:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Create an account <code>"A"</code> with the balance of 100.0</li>

                            <li>Create an account <code>"B"</code> with the balance of 0.0</li>

                            <li>Create an account <code>"C"</code> with the balance of 0.0</li>

                            <li>Transfer 50.0 from account A to account B</li>

                            <li>Transfer 25.0 from account B to account C</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Defining your own class - object variables</h3>

                <p>A class is defined to serve some meaningful whole. Often a "meaningful whole" represents
                something from the real world. If a computer program needs to handle personal data it could be sensible
                to define a separate class <code>Person</code> which then holds methods and attributes related to an
                individual.</p>

                <p>Let us go ahead and assume that we have a project frame with an empty main program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
<span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">class</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_classname">Main</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>

    <span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">static</span> <span class=
"sh_type">void</span> <span class="sh_function">main</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span>String<span class=
"sh_symbol">[]</span> args<span class="sh_symbol">)</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>       
    <span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>

<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>We will create a new class in our project. In NetBeans this can be done in <em>projects</em> on the
                left, from the right click menu select <em>new</em>, <em>java class</em>. We'll name the class in
                the dialog that pops up.</p>

                <p>Just like with variables and methods the name of the class should always be as descriptive as
                possible. Sometimes as a project progresses a class might transform into something different in order
                meet the programmer's needs. In situations like this it's possible to rename your class with
                ease (<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/java/k12-preview/netbeans-english.html">see the NetBeans
                guide</a>).</p>

                <p>Lets create a class named <code>Person</code>. The class will exist in its own
                <code>Person.java</code> file. So since the main program is in its own file the program now consists of
                two files total. At first the class will be empty:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
<span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">class</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_classname">Person</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>

<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>The class has to define what methods and attributes the objects created from the class will have.
                Let us decide that each person has a name and an age. It feels natural to represent the name as a
                String and the age as an integer. Let us add this to our schematics:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
<span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">class</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_classname">Person</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>
    <span class="sh_keyword">private</span> <span class="sh_usertype">String</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span>name<span class="sh_symbol">;</span>
    <span class="sh_keyword">private</span> <span class="sh_type">int</span> age<span class="sh_symbol">;</span>
<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>Above we defined that all instances created from the <code>Person</code> class have a name and an
                age. Defining the attributes happens a little like how it happens with normal variables. In this case
                though there's the keyword <code>private</code> in front of them. This means that <code>name</code>
                and <code>age</code> won't show outside of the object, but instead are hidden within it. Hiding
                things within an object is called <em>encapsulation</em>.</p>

                <p>Variables defined within a class are called <i>object variables</i>, <i>object fields</i> or
                <i>object attributes</i>. A beloved child has many names.</p>

                <p>So, we've defined the schematics -- the class -- for the person object. All person objects have
                the variables <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>. The 'state' of the objects is determined
                by the values that have been set to its variables.</p>

                <h3>Defining your own class - constructor, or "formatting the state"</h3>

                <p>When an object is created its starting state is defined at the same time. Self-defined objects are
                created for the most part in the same way as ready-made objects (<code>ArrayList</code>s for example)
                are created. Objects are created with the <code>new</code> command. When creating an object it'd be
                handy to be able to set the values of some of the variables of the object.</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
    <span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">static</span> <span class=
"sh_type">void</span> <span class="sh_function">main</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span>String<span class=
"sh_symbol">[]</span> args<span class="sh_symbol">)</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>
        <span class="sh_usertype">Person</span><span class="sh_normal"> </span>bob <span class=

        <span class="sh_comment">// ...</span>
    <span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>This can be achieved by defining the object creating method, <em>the constructor</em>. The
                constructor for the <code>Person</code> class that creates a new <code>Person</code> object has been
                defined in the following. In the constructor the person that is being created gets 0 as its age and its
                name it gets from the parameter of the constructor.</p>

                <p>The constructor always has the same name as the class. In the code above, the class is
                <code>Person</code> and the constructor is <code>public Person(String initialName)</code>. The value
                the constructor receives as a parameter is in parentheses after the name of the constructor. You can
                imagine the constructor as a method that Java runs when an object is created with the command <code>new
                Person("Bob");</code> Whenever an object is created from a class, the constructor of that
                class is called.</p>

                <p>A few notes: within the constructor there's a command <code>this.age = 0</code>. With it we set
                a value of this particular object; we set the internal variable age of "this" object. Another
                command is <code>this.name = initialName;</code>, again we give the internal variable name the String
                that is defined in the constructor. The variables <code>age</code> and <code>name</code> show in the
                constructor and elsewhere in the object automatically. They are referred to with the <code>this</code>
                prefix. Due to the <code>private</code> modifier the variables can't be seen from outside the
                object.</p>

                <p>One more thing: if the programmer doesn't create a constructor for the class, Java will
                automatically create a default one for it. A default constructor is a constructor that does nothing. So
                if you for some reason don't need a constructor you don't need to write one.</p>

                <h3>Class definition - methods</h3>

                <p>We already know how to create and initialize objects. However, objects are useless if they cannot do
                anything, so objects should have methods. Let us add to <code>Person</code> class a method that prints
                the object to screen:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String nameAtStart) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = nameAtStart;       
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>As seen, the method is written within the class. The method name is prefixed with <code>public
                void</code> since it is assumed that users of the object should be capable of using the method and the
                method should not return anything. With objects the keyword <code>static</code> is not used in method
                definitions. Next week we will clarify the reason behind that.</p>

                <p>Inside the method <code>printPerson</code> there is a single line of code that uses the object
                variables <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>. The prefix <code>this</code> is used to emphasize
                that we are referring to the name and age of <em>this</em> object. All the object variables are visible
                from all the methods of the object.</p>

                <p>Let us create three persons and ask them to print themselves:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person brian = new Person("Brian");
        Person martin = new Person("Martin");

        pekka.printPerson();
        brian.printPerson();
        martin.printPerson();
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>The output is:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 0 years
Brian, age 0 years
Martin, age 0 years
</pre>

                <div class="tehtavat">
                    <div class="tehtava">
                        <h3>Product</h3>

                        <p>Create a class <code>Product</code> that represents a product sold in a webshop. A product
                        has a price, amount and name.</p>

                        <p>A new class can be created as follows: Point at the project <em>073.Product</em> in the
                        <em>projects</em> tab and click the right mouse button. Then select <em>new</em> and <em>java
                        class</em>. When a dialog opens, give the class the name <code>Product</code>.</p>

                        <p>The class should have:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Constructor <code>public Product(String nameAtStart, double priceAtStart, int
                            amountAtStart)</code></li>

                            <li>Method <code>public void printProduct()</code> that prints a product in the following
                            form:

<pre>
    Banana, price 1.1, amount 13
</pre>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>More methods</h3>

                <p>Let us create a method that can be used to increase the age of a person by one:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    // ...

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;;    // same as this.age = this.age + 1;
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>As expected, the method is written inside the class <code>Person</code>. The method increases the
                value of object variable <code>age</code> by one.</p>

                <p>Let us call the method and see what happens:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person andrew = new Person("Andrew");

        pekka.printPerson();
        andrew.printPerson();

        System.out.println("");

        pekka.becomeOlder();
        pekka.becomeOlder();

        pekka.printPerson();
        andrew.printPerson();
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>Output:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 0 years
Andrew, age 0 years

Pekka, age 2 years
Andrew, age 0 years
</pre>

                <p>When born, both objects have age 0 due to the line <code>this.age = 0;</code> in the constructor.
                Method <code>becomeOlder</code> of object <code>pekka</code> is called twice. As the output shows, this
                causes the age of pekka to increase by two. It should be noted that when the method
                <code>becomeOlder</code> is called to object <code>pekka</code>, the other object <code>andrew</code>
                is not touched at all and he remains at age 0. So the state of an object is independent of the other
                objects!</p>

                <p>Also the object methods can return a value to the caller of the method. Let us define a method that
                can be used to ask for the age of a person:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    // ...

    public int getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>Now the <code>void</code> in the method definition is replaced with <code>int</code> since the value
                the method returns has the type integer. The following example demonstrates how the value returned by a
                method can be used:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person andrew = new Person("Andrew");

        pekka.becomeOlder();
        pekka.becomeOlder();

        andrew.becomeOlder();

        System.out.println( "Age of Pekka: "+pekka.getAge() );
        System.out.println( "Age of Andrew: "+andrew.getAge() );

        int total = pekka.getAge() + andrew.getAge();

        System.out.println( "Pekka and Andrew total of "+total+ " years old" );
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>Output:</p>

<pre>
Age of Pekka: 2
Age of Andrew: 1 

Pekka and Andrew total of 3 years old
</pre>

                        <code>DecreasingCounter</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class DecreasingCounter {
    private int value;   // object variable that remembers the value of the counter

    public DecreasingCounter(int valueAtStart) {
        this.value = valueAtStart;

    }

    public void decrease() {
        // write here the code that decrements the value of counter by one
    }

    // and here the rest of the methods
}
</pre>

                        <p>The counter can be used as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        counter.printValue();

        counter.decrease();
        counter.printValue();

        counter.decrease();

                        <p>Output should be:</p>

<pre>
value: 10
value: 9
value: 8
</pre>

                        <p>The constructor of <code>DecreasingCounter</code> gets as parameter the initial value of
                        counter. In the example the constructor parameter is <code>10</code> which is then set to the
                        object variable <code>this.value</code>. The value of the counter can be printed with method
                        <code>printValue()</code>. The method <code>decrease()</code> should decrease the value of
                        counter by one.</p>

                        <h4>Implementing method decrease()</h4>

                        <p>Implement the method <code>decrease()</code> so that when called, the object variable
                        <code>this.value</code> is decreased by one. When this is done, your program should work as the
                        example above.</p>

                        <h4>Value remains positive</h4>

                        <p>Change your implementation of the method <code>decrease()</code> so that the value of the
                        counter will not drop below zero. If the method is called when the value is zero, nothing
                        should happen:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {

        counter.decrease();

                        <p>In this assignment we will implement a class <code>Menu</code> that holds information about
                        meals that are available in a cafeteria.</p>

                        <p>Our starting point is the following class skeleton:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Menu {

    private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; meals;

    public Menu() {
        this.meals = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    }

    // Implement the methods here
}
</pre>

                        <p>Menu objects store the information on meals using an object variable of type
                        ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</p>

                        <h4>Adding a meal to menu</h4>

                        <p>Implement the method <code>public void addMeal(String meal)</code> that adds a new meal to
                        the list <code>this.meals</code> of a Menu object. If the meal is already on the list, it
                        shoulf not be added.</p>

                        <h4>Printing the menu</h4>

                        <p>Implement the method <code>public void printMeals()</code>, that prints the meals on a menu.
                        As example the output after three additions could be:</p>

<pre>
Hamburger
Fish'n'Chips
Sauerkraut
</pre>

                        <h4>Clearing a menu</h4>

                        <p>Implement the method <code>public void clearMenu()</code> that clears a menu, so after
                        calling this method the menu should be empty. Class <code>ArrayList</code> has a method that is
                        useful here. Within your method body write <code>meals.</code> and see how NetBeans helps you

                <p>Let us tune up the solution a little further. Now a person can only be printed so that in addition
                to the name, the age also gets printed out. In some cases we might only want the name of the object.
                Let us tailor up a method for the purpose:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
<span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">class</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_classname">Person</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>
    <span class="sh_comment">// ...</span>

    <span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_usertype">String</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_function">getName</span><span class="sh_symbol">()</span> <span class=
"sh_cbracket">{</span>
        <span class="sh_keyword">return</span> <span class="sh_keyword">this</span><span class=
"sh_symbol">.</span>name<span class="sh_symbol">;</span>
    <span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>The method <code>getName</code> returns the object variable <code>name</code> to its caller. The
                name of the method might seem a little odd (or not). In Java it is considered the 'correct' way
                to name an object-variable-returning method in this manner; as <code>getVariableName</code>. Methods
                like these are often called 'getters'.</p>

                <p>Let us edit the main program to use the new 'getter':</p>

                <h3>toString</h3>

                <p>We've been partially guilty of a bad programming style; we've created a method with which
                the object is printed, the <code>printPerson</code> one. The recommended way of doing this is by
                defining a method that returns a "character string representation" of the object. In Java a
                method returning a String representation is always called <code>toString</code>. Let us define this
                method for person:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
<span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_keyword">class</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_classname">Person</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>
    <span class="sh_comment">// ...</span>

    <span class="sh_keyword">public</span> <span class="sh_usertype">String</span><span class=
"sh_normal"> </span><span class="sh_function">toString</span><span class="sh_symbol">()</span> <span class=
"sh_cbracket">{</span>
        <span class="sh_keyword">return</span> <span class="sh_keyword">this</span><span class=
"sh_symbol">.</span>name <span class="sh_symbol">+</span> <span class=
"sh_string">", age "</span> <span class="sh_symbol">+</span> <span class="sh_keyword">this</span><span class=
"sh_symbol">.</span>age <span class="sh_symbol">+</span> <span class="sh_string">" years"</span><span class=
"sh_symbol">;</span>
    <span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>The method <code>toString</code> works just like <code>printPerson</code>, but instead of printing
                it returns the string representation, so the calls to the method can be used for printing at will.</p>

                <p>The method is used in a slightly surprising way:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">

    <span class="sh_cbracket">}</span>
</pre>

                <p>The principle is that <code>System.out.println</code>-method requests the string representation of
                an object and then prints it. The string representation a returning <code>toString</code>-method
                doesn't have to be written, since Java adds it automatically. When the programmer writes:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
        System<span class="sh_symbol">.</span>out<span class="sh_symbol">.</span><span class=
"sh_function">println</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span> andy <span class="sh_symbol">);</span>      
</pre>

                <p>Java completes the call during runtime to the format:</p>

<pre class="sh_java sh_sourceCode">
        System<span class="sh_symbol">.</span>out<span class="sh_symbol">.</span><span class=
"sh_function">println</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span> andy<span class="sh_symbol">.</span><span class=
"sh_function">toString</span><span class="sh_symbol">()</span> <span class="sh_symbol">);</span>
</pre>

                <p>This means that an object gets asked for its string representation. The string representation the
                object returns gets printed out normally with the <code>System.out.println</code>-command.</p>

                <p><b>We can get rid of the obsolete <code>printObject</code>-method.</b></p><!-- screencast -->

                        <h3>Lyyra-card</h3>

                        <p>The University of Helsinki students use so-called Lyyra cards to pay for their meals in
                        student cafeterias. In this assignment we implement class <code>LyyraCard</code> that simulates
                        the Lyyra card.</p>

                        <h4 class="req">Class skeleton</h4>

                        <p>Start by adding to your project the class <code>LyyraCard</code>.</p>

                        <p>Then implement the <code>LyyraCard</code> a constructor that gets the starting balance of
                        the card as parameter. The card saves the balance in the object variable <code>balance</code>.
                        Implement also the <code>toString</code> method that returns a string of the form "The
                        card has X euros".</p>

                        <p>The skeleton of class <code>LyyraCard</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class LyyraCard {
    private double balance;

    public LyyraCard(double balanceAtStart) {
        // write code here
    }

    public String toString() {
        // write code here
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>The following main-program can be used to test the program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
The card has 50.0 euros
</pre>

                        <h4 class="req">Paying with card</h4>

                        <p>Implement the following methods to <code>LyyraCard</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void payEconomical() {
        // write code here
    }

    public void payGourmet() {
        // write code here
    }
</pre>

                        <p>Method <code>payEconomical</code> should decrease the balance by 2.50 euros and method
                        <code>payGourmet</code> by 4.00 euros.</p>

                        <p>The following main program can be used to test the program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard card = new LyyraCard(50);
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payEconomical();
        System.out.println(card);

        card.payGourmet();
        card.payEconomical();
        System.out.println(card);
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
The card has 50.0 euros
The card has 47.5 euros
The card has 41.0 euros
</pre>

                        <h4 class="req">Balance nonnegative</h4>

                        <p>Change methods <code>payEconomical</code> and <code>payGourmet</code> so that if there is
                        not enought money, the balance does not change.</p>

                        <p>The following main program can be used to test the program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

                <h3>More methods</h3>

                <p>Let us continue with the class <code>Person</code>. We would be interested in knowing the <a href=
                "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">body mass index</a> of a person. To calculate that
                information we need to know their height and weight. We add for both the height and the weight object
                variables and methods that can be used to assign the variables a value. After those are in place, we
                can add also the method that calculates the body mass index. The class after the changes (only the
                parts affected by the change shown):</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
   public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;

    public Person(String initialName) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = initialName;    
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;  
    }

    public void setHeight(int newHeight) {
        this.height = newHeight;
    }

    public void setWeight(int newWeight) {
        this.weight = newWeight;
    }

    public double bodyMassIndex(){
        double heightDividedByZero = this.height / 100.0;
        return this.weight / ( heightDividedByZero * heightDividedByZero );
    }

    // ...
}      
</pre>

                <p>We added object variables <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code> and methods
                <code>setHeight</code> and <code>setWeight</code> that can be used to give values to the variables. In
                naming the methods we follow the Java convention to call a method that just sets a new value to a
                variable <code>setVariableName</code>, this type of methods are usually called <em>setter
                methods</em>.</p>

                <p>The new methods in use:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person matti = new Henkilo("Matti");
        Person john = new Henkilo("John");

        matti.setHeight(180);
        matti.setWeight(86);

        john.setHeight(175);
        john.setWeight(64);

        System.out.println( matti.getName() + ", body mass index: " + matti.bodyMassIndex() );
        System.out.println( john.getName() + ", body mass index: " + john.bodyMassIndex() );
</pre>

                <p>The output:</p>

<pre>
Matti, body mass index: on 26.54320987654321
John, body mass index: on 20.897959183673468
</pre>

                <h3>Object variable and parameter with identical name</h3>

                <p>Above, the method <code>setHeight</code> assigns the objec variable <code>height</code> the value of
                the parameter <code>newHeight</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void setHeight(int newHeight) {
        this.height = newHeight;
    }
</pre>

                <p>The parameter could also be named identically with the object variable:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }
</pre>

                <p>Now the name <code>height</code> menans the parameter <em>height</em> and the identically named
                object variable is referred to as <code>this.height</code>. The following would not work since the
                object variable <em>height</em> is not referred to at all in the code:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        // DOES NOT WORK!
        height = height; 
        // this just assigns the value of the parameter to the parameter itself
    }

</pre>

                <h3>Contolling the number of decimals when printing a float</h3>

                <p>The number of decimals in the last output was far too high, two decimals would be enough. One
                technique to control how a float number is printed is to use the command
                <code>String.format</code>.</p>

                <p>If <code>value</code> is float, the command <code>String.value( "%.2f", value )</code>
                returns a string where the value is rounded to contain 2 decimals. The number between dot and f defines
                the amount of decimals shown.</p>

                <p>So after changing the code to the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    System.out.println( matti.getName() + ", body mass index: " + String.format( "%.2f", matti.bodyMassIndex() ) );
    System.out.println( john.getName() + ", body mass index: " + String.format( "%.2f", john.bodyMassIndex() ) );
</pre>

                <p>The output is:</p>

<pre>
Matti,  body mass index: 26,54
John,  body mass index: 20,90
</pre>

                <p>Method <code>String.format</code> is perhaps not the most flexible way that Java provides for
                formatting float values but it is simple to use and suits our purposes well.</p>

                        <h3>Clock using a counter</h3>

                        <p>We start by implementing a class <code>BoundedCounter</code> and then use counter objects to
                        implement a clock.</p>

                        <h4 class="req">BoundedCounter</h4>

                        <p>Implement class <code>BoundedCounter</code> with the following functionality:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>counter has an object variable that remembers the <em>value</em> of the counter. The
                            value is within the range 0..upperBound</li>

                            <li>At the start the value is 0.</li>

                            <li>The upper bound of the value is defined by the constructor parameter</li>

                            <li>The method <code>next</code> increments the value of the counter. If the value would be
                            more that the upper limit, it wraps around and becomes zero.</li>

                            <li>Method <code>toString</code> returns a string representation of the counter value.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The skeleton of the class is the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class BoundedCounter {
    private int value;
    private int upperLimit;

    public BoundedCounter(int upperLimit) {
        // write code here
    }

    public void next() {
        // write code here
    }

    public String toString() {
        // write code here
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p><b>Note</b>: you can't return an integer value directly in method toString since the
                        method should return a string. Integer variable <code>value</code> can be turned into a string
                        by prefixing it with an empty string: <code>"" + value</code>.</p>

                        <p>A main program that uses the counter:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BoundedCounter counter = new BoundedCounter(4);
        System.out.println("Value at start: " + counter );

        int i = 0; 
        while ( i &lt; 10) {
            counter.next();
            System.out.println("Value: " + counter );
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>In the constructor a upper limit of 4 is given to the new counter object, so the value of
                        the counter should be within the range 0...4. Note how the method <code>next</code> increases
                        the value until it hits the upper limit and becomes zero again:</p>

<pre>
Value at start: 0
Value: 1
Value: 2
Value: 3
Value: 4
Value: 0
Value: 1
Value: 2
Value: 3
Value: 4
Value: 0
</pre>

                        <h4 class="req">Printing the initial zero</h4>

                        <p>Imrove <code>toString</code> so that if the value of the counter is less than 10, it
                        prefixes the value with 0. So if the value of the counter is e.g. 3, toString should produce
                        "03". If the value is at least 10, e.g. 12, the returned string would be
                        "12".</p>

                        <p>A main program that demonstrates the desired functionality of the improved toString.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BoundedCounter counter = new BoundedCounter(14);
        System.out.println("Value at start: " + counter );

        int i = 0; 
        while ( i &lt; 16){
            counter.next();
            System.out.println("value: " + counter );
            i++; 
        }
    }
}

                        <h4 class="req">The first version of the clock</h4>

                        <p>With two counter objects we can build a simple clock. Hours can be represented by a counter
                        with upper bound 23 and minutes by a counter with upper bound 59. As we all know, when minutes
                        wrap around from 59 to 0, hours advance by one.</p>

                        <p>First you should implement method <code>getValue</code> to counter class:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public int getValue() {
        // write here code that returns the value
    }
</pre>

                        <p>Then implement the clock in your main method in the following style:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BoundedCounter minutes = new BoundedCounter(59);
        BoundedCounter hours = new BoundedCounter(23);     

        int i = 0;
        while ( i &lt; 121 ) {
            System.out.println( hours + ":" + minutes);   // the current time printed
            // advance minutes
            // if minutes become zero, advance hours
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
00:00
00:01
...
00:59
01:00
01:01
01:02
...
01:59
02:00
</pre>

                        <h4 class="req">The second version of the clock</h4>

                        <p>Firstly implement the method <code>setValue</code> to class <code>BoundedCounter</code>. The
                        method should set the value of the parameter to the counter unless the parameter is less that
                        zero or larger than the upper bound. In those cases, the method does not have any effect.</p>

                        <p>Then add a seconds counter to your clock. The clock should now be like the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        Scanner lukija = new Scanner(System.in);
        BoundedCounter seconds = new BoundedCounter(59);
        BoundedCounter minutes = new BoundedCounter(59);
        BoundedCounter hours = new BoundedCounter(23);

        System.out.print("seconds: ");
        int s = // ask the initial value of seconds from the user
        System.out.print("minutes: ");
        int m = // ask the initial value of minutes from the user
        System.out.print("hours: ");
        int h = // ask the initial value of hours from the user

        seconds.setValue(s);
        minutes.setValue(m);
        hours.setValue(h);

        int i = 0;
        while ( i &lt; 121 ) {
          // like in previous but seconds taken into account
         i++;
        }

    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>Ensure that all works as expected when starting e.g. with time<i>23:59:50</i>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Bonus: eternal clock (exercise not assessed with TMC!)</strong></p>

                        <p>Before you start, submit the exercise for assesment.</p>

                        <p>Change your main as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        BoundedCounter seconds = new BoundedCounter(59);
        BoundedCounter minutes = new BoundedCounter(59);
        BoundedCounter hours = new BoundedCounter(23);

        seconds.setValue(50);
        minutes.setValue(59);
        hours.setValue(23);

        while ( true ) {
            System.out.println( hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds );
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            // put here the logic to advance your clock by one second
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>Now the clock goes on forever and the value is updated as it should be, once in a second. A
                        second is waited with the command <code>Thread.sleep(1000);</code> The parameter in the command
                        is the time to sleep in milliseconds. In order to use the sleep command, you should do an
                        addition to the definition of main: <code>public static void main(String[] args) <b>throws
                        Exception</b> {</code></p>

                        <p>You can end the eternal clock by pressing the red box in the NetBeans console (i,e, the area
                        in NB where the output of programs gets printed).</p>

                <p><big><b>Important notes regarding the use of objects. Make sure to read these.</b></big></p>

                <p>Object oriented programming is mostly about turning concepts into their own entities, or in other
                words forming abstractions. One might think that it's pointless to create an object that only holds
                one number in it, and that the same could be achieved with simple <code>int</code> variables. This is
                not the case. If a clock consists of just 3 int variables that are then increased, the program loses
                some human readability. It becomes more difficult to "see" what the program is about. Earlier
                in the material we mentioned the advice of the renown programmer Kent Beck: <em>"Any fool can
                write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can
                understand"</em>, since the hand of a clock is actually its own clearly definable concept, it is a
                good idea to create it its own class - <code>BoundedCounter</code> - for the sake of human
                readability.</p>

                <p>Turning a concept into a class of its own is a good idea for a lot of reasons. Firstly some details
                (ie. when the counter makes a full round) can be hidden inside the class (<em>abstracted</em>). Instead
                of writing an if-clause and an assignment operation, it is enough that the user of the counter calls
                the descriptively named method <code>next()</code>. In addition to clocks the created counter might be
                good for being used as a building block for other projects too, so a class made from a clear concept
                can be very versatile. Another huge advantage we gain by writing code this way is that when the details
                of the mechanics are hidden they can be changed if need be.</p>

                <p>We established that a clock contains three hands, it consists of three concepts. Actually the clock
                itself is a concept too and next week we'll make the class Clock, so we can create distinct Clock
                objects. Clock will be an object which in the functionality is based on "simpler" objects,
                the hands. This is the grand idea of object oriented programming: a program is built out of small,
                clearly defined co-operating objects.</p>

                <p>Now we'll take some careful first steps in the object world. Towards the end of the course,
                objects will start to come to you naturally and the idea of <em>programs being built out of small, well
                defined, co-operating pieces</em> - which at this point might feel incomprehensible - will become
                something you'll take for granted.</p>

                <h3>Calling other methods within an object</h3>

                <p>Objects can also call ins own methods. Let us assume we'd like to include body mass index in the
                string representation of the person objects. Instead of calculating the body mass index in the toString
                method, a better idea is to call the method <code>bodyMassInded</code> from the <code>toString</code>
                method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + this.bodyMassIndex();
    }
</pre>

                <p>As can be seen, an object can call its own method by prefixing the method name with
                <code>this</code> and dot. The this is not necessary, so also the following works:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + bodyMassIndex();
    }
</pre><!-- screencast -->

                <p>Now it is time to continue practising programming.</p>

                <h2>Randomness</h2>

                <p>When programming you may occasionally need to simulate random events. Situations such as the
                unpredictability of weather, or surprising moves on the AI's part in a computer game can often be
                simulated with random number generators, running on a computer. In Java there is a ready-made class
                <code>Random</code>, which you can use in the following way:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.Random;

public class Randomizing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random randomizer = new Random(); // creates a random number generator
        int i = 0;

        while (i &lt; 10) {
            // Generates and prints out a new random number on each round of the loop
            System.out.println(randomizer.nextInt(10)); 
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>In the code above you first create an instance of the class <code>Random</code>, with the keyword
                <code>new</code> -- exactly as when creating objects implementing other classes. An object of type
                Random has the method <code>nextInt</code>, to which you can give an integer value as a parameter. The
                method returns a random integer within the range <em>0..(the integer given as parameter- 1)</em>.</p>

                <p>The printout of this program could be as follows:</p>

<pre>
2
2
4
3
4
5
6
0
7
8
</pre>

                <p>We will need floating point numbers for example when dealing with probability calculations. In
                computing probabilities are usually calculated with figures within the range [0..1]. An object of the
                class Random can return random floating point numbers with the method <code>nextDouble</code>.
                Let's consider the following probabilities of weather conditions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sleet with the probability 0.1 (10%)</li>

                    <li>Snow with the probability 0.3 (30%)</li>

                    <li>Sunny with the probability 0.6 (60%)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Using the estimates above, let's create a weather forecaster.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class WeatherForecaster {
    private Random random;

    public WeatherForecaster() {
        this.random = new Random();
    } 

    public String forecastWeather() {
        double probability = this.random.nextDouble();

        if (probability &lt;= 0.1) {
            return "Sleet";
        } else if (probability &lt;= 0.4) { // 0.1 + 0.3
            return "Snow";
        } else { // the rest, 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6
            return "Sunny";
        } 
    }

    public int forecastTemperature() {
        return (int) ( 4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3 ); 
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>The method <code>forecastTemperature</code> is interesting in many ways. Within this method we are
                calling the method <code>this.random.nextGaussian()</code>, just like any other time we've called a
                method in the previous examples. Interestingly, this method of the class Random returns a figure in
                <em>normal distribution</em> (if you have no interest in the different varieties of random figures,
                that's okay!).</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public int forecastTemperature() {
        return (int) ( 4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3 ); 
    }
</pre>

                <p>In the expression above, just as interesting is the section <code>(int)</code>. This part of the
                expression changes the bracketed floating point number into an integer value. A corresponding method
                transforms integer values into floating point numbers: <code>(double) integer</code>. This is called an
                <em>explicit type conversion</em>.</p>

                <p>Let's create a class with a main method that uses the class <code>WeatherForecaster</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherForecaster forecaster = new WeatherForecaster();

        // Use a list to help you organise things 
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; days = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
        Collections.addAll(days, "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun");

        System.out.println("Weather forecast for the next week:");
        for(String day : days) {
            String weatherForecast = forecaster.forecastWeather();
            int temperatureForecast = forecaster.forecastTemperature(); 

            System.out.println(day + ": " + weatherForecast + " " + temperatureForecast + " degrees.");
        }
    }
}
</pre>

                <p>The printout from this program could be as follows:</p>

<pre>
Weather forecast for the next week:
Mon: Snow 1 degrees.
Tue: Snow 1 degrees.
Wed: Sunny -2 degrees.
Thu: Sunny 0 degrees.
Fri: Snow -3 degrees.
Sat: Snow -3 degrees.
Sun: Sunny -5 degrees.

                        <h3>Game logic for Hangman</h3>

                        <p>Your friend designed a Hangman game that looks like the following:</p>

                        <p><img src="img/hirsipuu-tikkuukko.png"></p>

                        <p>Your friend has programmed the user interface and also a skeleton for the game logic. Now
                        she asks you to finish the remaining pieces of the game logic.</p>

                        <p>Amongst other stuff with TMC you get the following skeleton for the class
                        <code>HangmanLogic</code></p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class HangmanLogic {

    private String word;
    private String guessedLetters;
    private int numberOfFaults;

    public HangmanLogic(String sana) {

    public int losingFaultAmount() {
        return 12;
    }

    public void guessLetter(String letter) {
        // program here the functionality for making a guess

        // if the letter has already been guessed, nothing happens

        // it the word does not contains the guessed letter, the number of faults increases
        // the letter is added among the already guessed letters
    }

    public String hiddenWord() {
        // program here the functionality for building the hidden word

        // create the hidden word by iterating through this.word letter by letter
        // if the letter in turn is within the guessed words, put it in the hidden word
        // if the letter is not among the guessed ones, replace it with _ in the hidden word 

        // return the hidden word at the end

        return "";
    }
}
</pre>

                        <p>In this assignment <em>you should only touch class <code>HangmanLogic</code> and implement
                        the functionality of the methods <code>guessLetter(String letter)</code> and
                        <code>hiddenWord()</code></em>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Testing the code</strong></p>

                        <p>The tmc-project includes <em>two</em> classes that help you in the testing. The class
                        <code>Main</code> starts the graphical version of the game. The class <code>TestProgram</code>
                        can be used to test the class <code>HangmanLogic</code>.</p>

                        <h4>Guessing a letter</h4>

                        <p>Touch only the method <code>guessLetter(String letter)</code> in this assignment!</p>

                        <p>When a user guesses a letter, the user interface calls method <code>guessLetter</code> which
                        is supposed to take care of action related to guessing a letter. First, it should check if the
                        letter has already been guessed. In that case the method does not do anything.</p>

                        <p>The method increases the number of faults (<code>this.numberOfFaults</code>) if the word
                        (<code>this.word</code>) does not contain the guessed letter. The letter is added among the
                        already guessed letters (the object variable <code>this.guessedLetters</code>).</p>

                        <p>An example of how the method <code>guessLetter</code> should work:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  HangmanLogic l = new HangmanLogic("kissa");
  System.out.println("guessing: A, D, S, F, D");
  l.guessLetter("A");   // correct
  l.guessLetter("D");   // wrong
  l.guessLetter("S");   // correct
  l.guessLetter("F");   // wrong
  l.guessLetter("D");   // This should not have any effect on the number of faults since D was already guessed
  System.out.println("guessed letters: "+l.guessedLetters());
  System.out.println("number of faults: "+l.numberOfFaults());
</pre>

<pre>
guessing: A, D, S, F, D
guessed letters: ADSF
number of faults: 2
</pre>

                        <h4>Creating the hidden word</h4>

                        <p>The Hangman user interface shows a hidden version of the word to the user. In the above
                        figure the hidden word is METO_I. All the letters that the user has already guessed are shown
                        in the hidden word but the rest of the letters are replaced with underscores. In this part of
                        the assignment you should complete the method <code>hiddenWord</code> of Hangman logic that
                        takes care of building the hidden word for the user interface.</p>

                        <p>Commands <code>while</code>, <code>charAt</code> and <code>contains</code> might be useful
                        here. Note that a single char can be made into a string as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
char c = 'a';
String aString = "" + c;
</pre>

                        <p>An example of how the method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
HangmanLogic l = new HangmanLogic("kissa");
System.out.println("word is: "+l.hiddenWord());

System.out.println("guessing: A, D, S, F, D");
l.guessLetter("A");
l.guessLetter("D");
l.guessLetter("S");
l.guessLetter("F");
l.guessLetter("D");
System.out.println("guessed letters: "+l.guessedLetters());
System.out.println("number of faults: "+l.numberOfFaults());
System.out.println("word now: "+l.hiddenWord());
</pre>

<pre>
word is: _____
guessing: A, D, S, F, D
guessed letters: ADSF
number of faults: 2
word now: __SSA
</pre>

                        <p>Now you can test the game by using class <code>Main</code>. You can change the guessed word
                        by changing the constructor parameter of the game logic:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
        HangmanLogic logic = new HangmanLogic("parameter");
        HangmanUI game = new HangmanUI(logic);
        game.start();
</pre>

                        <p>The game is played with the keyboard. You can end the game by pressing x in the upper left
                        corner of the game window..</p>

            <h2>More about objects and classes</h2>

            <h3>Multiple constructors</h3>

            <p>Let's return to the class that handles Persons again. The class <code>Person</code> currently looks
            like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int height;
    private int weight;

     public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " I am " + this.age + " years old");
    }

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;
    }

    public boolean adult(){
        if ( this.age &lt; 18 ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public double weightIndex(){
        double heightInMeters = this.height/100.0;

        return this.weight / (heightInMeters*heightInMeters);
    }   

    public String toString(){
        return this.name + " I am " + this.age + " years old, my weight index is " + this.weightindex();
    }

    public void setHeight(int height){
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getHeight(){
        return this.height;
    }

    public int getWeight() {
        return this.weight;
    }

    public void setWeight(int weight) {
        this.weight = weight;
    }  

    public String getName(){
        return this.name;
    }  
}
</pre>

            <p>All person objects are 0 years old at creation, since the constructor sets it to 0:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }
</pre>

            <p>We also want to create a person so that in addition to name, we can give an age as a parameter. This can
            be achieved easily, since multiple constructors can exist. Let's make an alternative constructor. You
            don't need to remove the old one.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }
</pre>

            <p>Now creating objects can be done in two different ways:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);
        Person esko = new Person("Esko");

        System.out.println( pekka );
        System.out.println( esko );
    }
</pre>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
Esko, age 0 years
</pre>

            <p>The technique in which a class has two constructors is called <em>constructor overloading</em>. A class
            can have multiple constructors, which are different from one another by the parameter quanitities and/or
            types. However, it is not possible to create two different constructors that have exactly the same type of
            parameters. We cannot add in a constructor <code>public Person(String name, int weight)</code> on top of
            the old ones, since it is impossible for Java to tell the difference between this one and the one in which
            the integer stands for the age.</p>

            <h3>Calling your own constructor</h3>

            <p>But wait, in chapter 21 we noted that "copy-paste"-code isn't too great of an idea. When
            we inspect the overloaded constructors above, we notice that they have the same things repeated in them.
            We're not ok with this.</p>

            <p>The higher constructor actually is a special case of the constructor below it. What if the higher
            constructor could 'call' the constructor below it? This can be done, since you can call another
            constructor from within a constructor with <code>this</code>!</p>

            <p>Let's change the higher constructor that itself does nothing, but only calls the constructor below
            it and asks it to set the age to 0:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public Person(String name) {
        this(name, 0);  // run here the other constructor's code and set the age parameter to 0
    }

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }
</pre>

            <p>Calling a class's own constructor <code>this(name, 0);</code> might seem a little peculiar. But we
            can imagine that at the call it'll automatically copy-paste the code from the constructor below and
            that 0 is entered to the age parameter.</p>

            <h3>Overloading a method</h3>

            <p>Just like constructors, methods can also be overloaded, multiple versions of a method can exist. Again
            the parameter types of different versions have to be different. Let's create another version of the
            <code>becomeOlder</code>, which enables aging the person the amount of years that is entered as a
            parameter:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age = this.age + 1;
    }

    public void becomeOlder(int years) {
        this.age = this.age + years;
    }
</pre>

            <p>In the following "Pekka" is born as a 24-year old, ages one year, and then 10:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );
        pekka.becomeOlder();
        System.out.println( pekka );
        pekka.becomeOlder(10);
        System.out.println( pekka );
</pre>

            <p>Prints:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 25 years
Pekka, age 35 years
</pre>

            <p>So now a person has two <code>becomeOlder</code> methods. The method that is chosen to be run depends on
            the amount of parameters entered in to the method call. The method <code>becomeOlder</code> can also be run
            through the method <code>becomeOlder(int years)</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.becomeOlder(1);
    }

    public void becomeOlder(int years) {
        this.age = this.age + years;
    }

                    counter also has an optional <em>check</em> that prevents the counter from going below 0. The class

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>public Counter(int startingValue, boolean check)</code> creates a new counter with
                        the given value. The check is on if the parameter given to <code>check</code> was
                        <code>true</code>.</li>

                        <li><code>public Counter(int startingValue)</code> creates a new counter with the given value.
                        The check on the new counter should be off.</li>

                        <li><code>public Counter(boolean check)</code> creates a new counter with the starting value of
                        0. The check is on if the parameter given to <code>check</code> was <code>true</code>.</li>

                        <li><code>public Counter()</code> creates a new counter with the starting value of 0 and with
                        checking off.</li>

                    <p>and the following methods:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>public int value()</code> returns the current value of the counter</li>

                        <li><code>public void increase()</code> increases the value of the counter by one</li>

                        <li><code>public void decrease()</code> decreases the value of the counter by one, but not
                        below 0 if the check is on</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Alternative methods</h4>

                        <li><code>public void decrease(int decreaseAmount)</code> decreases the counter's value by
                        the amount given by the parameter, but not below 0 if the check is on. If the value of the
                        parameter is negative the value of the counter won't change.</li>

            <h3>Object is at the end of a wire</h3>

            <p>In chapter 20 we noted that <code>ArrayList</code> is at the end of a wire. Also objects are 'at the
            end of a wire'. What does this mean? Let's inspect the following example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );
    }
</pre>

            <p>When we run the sentence <code>Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);</code> an object is
            born. The object can be accessed through the variable <code>pekka</code>. Technically speaking the object
            is not within the variable <code>pekka</code> (in the box 'pekka'), but <code>pekka</code> refers
            to the object that was born. In other words the object is 'at the end of a wire' that is attached
            to a variable named <code>pekka</code>. The concept could be visualized like this:</p>

            <p><img src="img/lanka1.PNG"></p>

            <p>Let's add to the program a variable <code>person</code> of the type <code>Person</code> and set its
            starting value to <code>pekka</code>. What happens now?</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        Person person = pekka;
        henkilo.becomeOlder(25);

        System.out.println( pekka );
    }
</pre>

            <p>Prints:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
</pre>

            <p>So in the beginning Pekka was 24 years old, a Person object at the end of a wire attached to a
            <code>Person</code> variable is aged by 25 years and as a consequence of that Pekka becomes older!
            What's going on here then?</p>

            <p>The command <code>Person person = pekka;</code> makes it so that <code>person</code> begins to refer to
            the same object that <code>pekka</code> refers to. So a copy of the object isn't born, but instead both
            of the variables refer to the same object. With the command <code>Person henkilo = pekka;</code> a <em>copy
            of the wire</em> is born. As a picture (Note: in the picture p refers to the variable pekka, and h to the
            variable person in the main program. The variable names have also been abbreviated in some of the following
            pictures.):</p>

            <p><img src="img/lanka2.PNG"></p>

            <p>In the example "an unknown <code>person</code> steals Pekka's identity". In the following,
            we've expanded the example so that a new object is created and <code>pekka</code> begins to refer to a
            new object:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        Person person = pekka;
        henkilo.becomeOlder(25);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        pekka = new Person("Pekka Mikkola", 24);
        System.out.println( pekka );
    }
</pre>

            <p>Prints:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
Pekka Mikkola, age 24 years
</pre>

            <p>The variable <code>pekka</code> refers to one object, but then begins to refer to another. Here's
            the situation after running the previous line of code:</p>

            <p><img src="img/lanka3.PNG"></p>

            <p>Let's develop the example further by making <code>person</code> to refer to 'nothing', to
            <code>null</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        Person person = pekka;
        henkilo.becomeOlder(25);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        pekka = new Person("Pekka Mikkola", 24);
        System.out.println( pekka );

        person = null;
        System.out.println( person );
    }
</pre>

            <p>After running that, the situation looks like this:</p>

            <p><img src="img/lanka4.PNG"></p>

            <p>Nothing refers to the second object. The object has become 'garbage'. Java's garbace
            collector cleans up the garbage every now and then by itself. If this didn't happen, the garbage would
            pile up in the computer's memory until the execution of the program is done.</p>

            <p>We notice when on the last line that we try to print 'nothing' (<code>null</code>) on the last
            line. This is what happens:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
Pekka, age 49 years
Pekka Mikkola, age 24 years
null
</pre>

            <p>What happens if we try to call a "nothing's" method, for example the method
            <code>weightIndex</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);

        System.out.println( pekka );

        Person person = null;
        System.out.println( henkilo.weightIndex() );
    }
</pre>

            <p>Result:</p>

<pre>
Pekka, age 24 years
<font color="red">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at Main.main(Main.java:20)
Java Result: 1</font>
</pre>

            <p>Not good. This might be the first time in your life that you see the text <b>NullPointerException</b>.
            But we can assure you that it won't be the last. NullPointerException is an exception state, when we
            try to call methods of an object with the value <code>null</code>.</p>

            <h3>An object as a method parameter</h3>

            <p>We've seen that a method can have, for example <code>int, double, String</code> or ArrayList as its
            parameter. ArrayLists and character strings are objects, so as one might guess a method can take any type
            of object as a parameter. Let's demonstrate this with an example.</p>

            <p>People whose weight index exceeds a certain limit are accepted into the Weight Watchers. The limit is
            not the same in all Weight Watchers associations. Let's make a class corresponding to the Weight
            Watchers association. As the object is being created the lowest acceptance limit is passed to the
            constructor as a parameter.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    private double lowestWeightIndex;

    public WeightWatchersAssociation(double indexLimit) {
        this.lowestWeightIndex = indexLimit;
    }

}
</pre>

            <p>Next we'll create a method, with which we can check if a person is accepted to the association, in
            other words we check if a person's weight index is large enough. The method returns <code>true</code>
            if the person that is passed in as a parameter is accepted and <code>false</code> if not.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public boolean isAcceptedAsMember(Person person) {
        if ( person.weightIndex() &lt; this.lowestWeightIndex ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>The method <code>isAcceptedAsMember</code> of the WeightWatchersAssociation object gets a
            <code>Person</code> object as its parameter (or more accurately the wire to the person). And then calls the
            method <code>weightIndex</code> of the person that it received as a parameter.</p>

            <p>In the following is a test main program in which a person object <code>matti</code> and then a person
            object <code>juhana</code> is passed to the weight watchers association's method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person matti = new Person("Matti");
        matti.setWeight(86);
        matti.setHeight(180);

        Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");
        juhana.setWeight(64);
        juhana.setHeight(172);

        WeightWatchersAssociation kumpulasWeight = new WeightWatchersAssociation(25);

        if ( kumpulasWeight.isAcceptedAsMember(matti) ) {
            System.out.println( matti.getName() + " is accepted as a member");
        } else {
            System.out.println( matti.getName() + " is not accepted as a member");
        }

        if ( kumpulasWeight.isAcceptedAsMember(juhana) ) {
            System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is accepted as a memberksi");
        } else {
            System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is not accepted as a member");
        }
    }
</pre>

            <p>The program prints:</p>

<pre>
Matti is accepted as a member
Juhana is not accepted as a member

                    <h3>Reformatory</h3>

                    <p>In this assignment we use the already given class <code>Person</code> and are supposed to build
                    a new class <code>Reformatory</code>. Reformatory objects do certain things to persons, e.g.
                    measure their weight and feed them.</p>

                    <p>Note: you should not alter the code in the class Person!</p>

                    <h4>Weight of a person</h4>

                    <p>The reformatory class already has a method skeleton <code>public int weight(Person
                    person)</code>:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Reformatory {

    public int weight(Person person) {
       // returns the weight of the parameter
       return -1;
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>The method gets a person object as a parameter. The method is supposed to return the weight of
                    the parameter, so the method should call a suitable method of <code>person</code>, get the return
                    value and then return it to the caller.</p>

                    <p>In the following a reformatory weight's two persons:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Reformatory eastHelsinkiReformatory = new Reformatory();

        Person brian = new Person("Brian", 1, 110, 7);
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 33, 176, 85);

        System.out.println(brian.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(brian) + " kilos");
        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
    }
</pre>

                    <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
Brian weight: 7 kilos
Pekka weight: 85 kilos
</pre>

                    <h4>feeding a person</h4>

                    <p>In the previous part of the assignment, the method <code>weight</code> queried some information
                    from the parameter object by calling its method. It is also possible to change the state of the
                    parameter. Add to class Reformatory the method <code>public void feed(Person person)</code> that
                    increases the weight of its parameter by one.</p>

                    <p>Next an example where first the weight of Pekka and Brian is measured and printed. Then
                    Reformatory feeds Brian three times and after that the weights are measured and printed again.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

        System.out.println(pekka.getName() + " weight: " + eastHelsinkiReformatory.weight(pekka) + " kilos");
    }
</pre>

                    <p>The output should reveal that Brian has gained 3 kilos:</p>

<pre>

Pekka weight: 85 kilos

Brian weight: 10 kilos
Pekka weight: 85 kilos
</pre>

                    <h4>Number of times a weight has been measured</h4>

                    <p>Add to class Reformatory the method <code>public int totalWeightsMeasured()</code> that returns

                    <h3>Lyyra card and Cash Register</h3>

                    <h4 class="req">The "stupid" Lyyra card</h4>

                    <p>Last exercise set we implemented the class LyyraCard. The card had methods for paying economical
                    and gourmet lunches and a method for loading money.</p>

                    <p>Last week's version of the card is however somehow problematic. The card knew the lunch
                    prices so that it could take the right price from the balance if a lunch was paid. What if the
                    lunch prices change? Or what if it is decided that LyyraCards could also be used to purchase
                    coffee? A change like these would mean that all the existing LyyraCards should be replaced with the
                    new ones with the right prices and/or new methods. This does not sound good at all!</p>

                    <p>A better solution is to only store the balance on the card and have all the inteligence in a
                    <em>cash register</em>.</p>

                    <p>We will soon program the cash register but let us start by completing the "stupid"
                    version of the Lyyra card. The card holds the balance and has only two methods, <code>public void
                    loadMoney(double amount)</code> that is already implemented and <code>public boolean pay(double
                    amount)</code> that you should complete according to the instructions below:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class LyyraCard {
    private double balance;

    public LyyraCard(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public double balance() {
        return this.balance;
    }

    public void loadMoney(double amount) {
        this.balance += amount;
    }

    public boolean pay(double amount){
       // the method checks if the balance of the card is at least the amount given as parameter
       // if not, the method returns false meaning that the card could not be used for the payment
       // if the balance is enough, the given amount is taken from the balance and true is returned
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>With the following main:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LyyraCard cardOfPekka = new LyyraCard(10);

        System.out.println("money on the card " + cardOfPekka.balance() );
        boolean succeeded = cardOfPekka.pay(8);
        System.out.println("money taken: " + succeeded );
        System.out.println("money on the card " + cardOfPekka.balance() );

        succeeded = cardOfPekka.pay(4);
        System.out.println("money taken: " + succeeded );
        System.out.println("money on the card " + cardOfPekka.balance() );
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>output should be</p>

money on the card 10.0
money taken: true
money on the card 2.0

                    of cash payments.</p>

                    <p>In following the skeleton of CashRegister that also has the information on how the methods

            <h3>Another object of the same type as a parameter to a method</h3>

            <p>We'll keep on working with the <code>Person</code> class. As we can remember, persons know their
            age:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int height;
    private int weight;

    // ...
}
</pre>

            <p>We want to compare the ages of two persons. The comparison can be done in a number of ways. We could
            define a getter method <code>getAge</code> for a person and comparing two persons in that case would happen
            like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
   Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
   Person juhana = new Person("Juhana")

   if ( pekka.getAge() &gt; juhana.getAge() ) {
       System.out.println( pekka.getName() + " if older than " + juhana.getName() );
   }
</pre>

            <p>We'll learn a slightly more object-oriented way to compare the ages of two people.</p>

            <p>We'll create a method <code>boolean olderThan(Person compared)</code> for the Person class, with
            which we can compare a certain person to a person that is given as a parameter.</p>

            <p>The method is meant to be used in the following way:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka", 24);
        Person antti = new Person("Antti", 22);

        if ( pekka.olderThan(antti) ) {  //  same as pekka.olderThan(antti)==true
            System.out.println( pekka.getName() + " is older than " + antti.getName() );
        } else {
            System.out.println( pekka.getName() + " isn't older than " + antti.getName() );
        }
</pre>

            <p>Here we ask Pekka if he is older than Antti, Pekka replies true if he is, and false if he isn't. In
            practice we call the method <code>olderThan</code> of the object that <code>pekka</code> refers to. And to
            which we give as a parameter the object that <code>antti</code> refers to.</p>

            <p>The program prints:</p>

<pre>
Pekka is older than Antti
</pre>

            <p>The program gets a person object as its parameter (or more accurately a reference to a person object,
            which is at 'the end of a wire') and then compares its own age <code>this.age</code> to the age of
            the compared <code>compared.age</code>. The implementation looks like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    // ...

    public boolean olderThan(Person compared) {
        if ( this.ika &gt; compared.age ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>Even though <code>age</code> is a <code>private</code> object variable, we can read the value of the
            variable by writing <code>compared.age</code>. This is because <code>private</code> variables can be read in
            all methods that the class in question contains. Note that the syntax resembles the calling of a method of
            an object. Unlike with calling a method, we refer to a field of an object, in which case we don't write
            the parentheses.</p>

            <h3>The date as an object</h3>

            <p>Another example of the same theme. Let's create a class, with which we can represent dates.</p>

            <p>Within an object the date is represented with three objct variables. Let's also make a method with
            which we can compare wheather the date is earlier than the date that is given as a parameter:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class MyDate {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;

    public MyDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        this.day = day;
        this.month = month;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;
    }

    public boolean earlier(MyDate compared) {
        // first we'll compare years
        if ( this.year &lt; compared.year ) {
            return true;
        }

        // if the years are the same, we'll compare the months
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month &lt; compared.month ) {
            return true;
        }

        // years and months the same, we'll compare the days
        if ( this.year == compared.year &amp;&amp; this.month == compared.month &amp;&amp;
                this.day &lt; compared.day ) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>Usage example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDate p1 = new MyDate(14, 2, 2011);
        MyDate p2 = new MyDate(21, 2, 2011);
        MyDate p3 = new MyDate(1, 3, 2011);
        MyDate p4 = new MyDate(31, 12, 2010);

        System.out.println( p1 + " earlier than " + p2 + ": " + p1.earlier(p2));
        System.out.println( p2 + " earlier than " + p1 + ": " + p2.earlier(p1));

        System.out.println( p2 + " earlier than " + p3 + ": " + p2.earlier(p3));
        System.out.println( p3 + " earlier than " + p2 + ": " + p3.earlier(p2));

        System.out.println( p4 + " earlier than " + p1 + ": " + p4.earlier(p1));
        System.out.println( p1 + " earlier than " + p4 + ": " + p1.earlier(p4));
}
</pre>

14.2.2011 earlier than 21.2.2011: true
21.2.2011 earlier than 14.2.2011: false

                    <h3>Apartment comparison</h3>

                    <p>The information system of a Housing service represents the apartments it has for sale using
                    objects of the following class:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Apartment {
  private int rooms;
  private int sqareMeters;
  private int pricePerSquareMeter;

  public Apartment(int rooms, int sqareMeters, int pricePerSquareMeter){

    this.sqareMeters = sqareMeters;
    this.pricePerSquareMeter = pricePerSquareMeter;
  }
}
</pre>

                    <p>Next you should implement a couple of methods that help in apartment comparisons.</p>

                    <h4>Larger</h4>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public boolean larger(Apartment otherApartment)</code> that returns
                    true if the Apartment object for which the method is called (<code>this</code>) is larger than the
                    apartment object given as parameter (<code>otherApartment</code>).</p>

                    <p>Example of the usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
  Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
  Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

  System.out.println( studioManhattan.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );       // false
  System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.larger(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );   // true
</pre>

                    <h4>Price difference</h4>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public int priceDifference(Apartment otherApartment)</code> that
                    returns the absolute value of the price difference of the Apartment object for which the method is
                    called (<code>this</code>) and the apartment object given as parameter
                    (<code>otherApartment</code>). The price of an apartment is <code>squareMeters *
                    pricePerSquareMeter.</code></p>

                    <p>Example of the usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
  Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
  Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

  System.out.println( studioManhattan.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );        // 71600
  System.out.println( fourAndKitchenBronx.priceDifference(twoRoomsBrooklyn) );    // 35400
</pre>

                    <h4>more expensive than</h4>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public boolean moreExpensiveThan(Apartment otherApartment)</code>
                    that returns true if the Apartment-object for which the method is called (<code>this</code>) has a
                    higher price than the apartment object given as parameter (<code>otherApartment</code>).</p>

                    <p>Example of the usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Apartment studioManhattan = new Apartment(1, 16, 5500);
  Apartment twoRoomsBrooklyn = new Apartment(2, 38, 4200);
  Apartment fourAndKitchenBronx = new Apartment(3, 78, 2500);

            <h3>Objects on a list</h3>

            <p>We've used <code>ArrayList</code>s in a lot of examples and assignments already. You can add
            character strings, for example, to an ArrayList object and going through the strings, searching, removing
            and sorting them and so forth, are painless actions.</p>

            <p>You can put any type of objects in ArrayLists. Let's create a person list, an
            <code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;</code> and put a few person objects in it:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; teachers = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();

        // first we can take a person into a variable
        Person teacher = new Person("Juhana");
        // and then add it to the list
        teachers.add(teacher);

        // or we can create the object as we add it:
        teachers.add( new Person("Matti") );
        teachers.add( new Person("Martin") );

        System.out.println("teachers as newborns: ");
        for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
            System.out.println( prs );
        }

        for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
            prs.becomeOlder( 30 );
        }

        System.out.println("in 30 years: ");
        for ( Person prs : teachers ) {
            System.out.println( prs );
        }
</pre>

            <p>The program prints:</p>

<pre>
teachers as newborns:
Juhana, age 0 years
Matti, age 0 years
Martin, age 0 years
in 30 years:

                    <p>The class should have the following methods:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A constructor that initializes the name and the student number with the given

                        <li><code>getName</code>, that returns the student name</li>

                        <li><code>getStudentNumber</code>, that returns the student number</li>

                        <li><code>toString</code>, that returns a String representation of the form: Pekka Mikkola

        System.out.println(pekka);
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

                    <h4 class="req">List of students</h4>

                    <p>Implement a main program that works as follws:</p>

Alan Turing (017635727)
Linus Torvalds (011288989)
Steve Jobs (013672548)
</pre>

                    <p>So the program asks for student information from the user until the user gives a student an
                    empty name. After the student info has been enteres, all the students are printed. From each
                    inputted name-studentnumber-pair, the program should create a Student object. The program should
                    store the students in an ArrayList which is defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
ArrayList&lt;Student&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Student&gt;();
</pre>

                    <h4 class="req">Search</h4>

                    <p>Extend the program of the previous part so that after the student info has been entered and
                    students printed, the user can search the student list based on a given search term. The extended
                    program should work in the following manner:</p>

                    <p><strong>TIP:</strong> in the search you should iterate (using for or while) through the student

            <h3>An object within an object</h3>

            <p>Objects can have objects within them, not only character strings but also self-defined objects.
            Let's get back to the <code>Person</code>-class again and add a birthday for the person. We can use the
            <code>MyDate</code>-object we created earlier here:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int weight;
    private int height;
    private MyDate birthMyDate;

    // ...
</pre>

            <p>Let's create a new constructor for persons, which enables setting a birthday:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = 0;
        this.height = 0;
        this.birthMyDate = new MyDate(day, month, year);
    }
</pre>

            <p>So because the parts of the date are given as constructor parameters (day, month, year), the date object
            is created out of them and then <i>inserted</i> to the object variable <code>birthMyDate</code>.</p>

            <p>Let's edit <code>toString</code> so that instead of age, it displays the birthdate:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", born " + this.birthMyDate;
    }
</pre>

            <p>And then let's test how the renewed Person class works:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person martin = new Person("Martin", 24, 4, 1983);

        Person juhana = new Person("Juhana", 17, 9, 1985);

        System.out.println( martin );
        System.out.println( juhana );
   }
</pre>

            <p>Prints:</p>

<pre>
Martin, born 24.4.1983
Juhana, born 17.9.1985
</pre>

            <p>In chapter 24.4, we noted that objects are 'at the end of a wire'. Take a look at that chapter
            again for good measure.</p>

            <p>Person objects have the object variables <code>name</code>, which is a String-object and
            <code>birthMyDate</code>, which is a MyDate object. The variables of person are consequently both objects,
            so technically speaking they don't actually exist within a person object, but are 'at the end of a
            wire'. In other words a person has a reference to the objects stored in its object variables. The
            concept as a picture:</p>

            <p><img src="img/person.PNG"></p>

            <p>The main program now has two person programs at the ends of wires. The persons have a name and a
            birthdate. Because both are objects, both are at the ends of wires the person holds.</p>

            <p>Birthday seems like a good expansion to the Person class. We notice, however, that the object variable
            <code>age</code> is becoming obsolete and should probably be removed since the age can be determined easily
            with the help of the current date and birthday. In Java, the current day can be figured out, for example,
            like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
        int day = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.DATE);
        int month = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.MONTH) + 1; // January is 0 so we add 1
        int year = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR);
        System.out.println("Today is " + day + "." + month + "." + year );
</pre>

            <p>When age is removed, the <code>olderThan</code> method has to be changed so that it compares birthdates.
            We'll do this as an excersise assignment.</p>

                    <h3>Clock object</h3>

                    <p>In assignment 78 we used objects of the class <code>BoundedCounter</code> to implement a clock
                    in the main method. In this assignment we will tranform the clock to an object. The skeleton of the
                    class clock looks like the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

public class Clock {
    private BoundedCounter hours;
    private BoundedCounter minutes;
    private BoundedCounter seconds;

    public Clock(int hoursAtBeginning, int minutesAtBeginning, int secondsAtBeginning) {
      // the counters that represent hours, minutes and seconds are created and set to have the correct initial values
    }

    public void tick(){
      // Clock advances by one second
    }

    public String toString() {
        // returns the string representation
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>Copy the class <code>BoundedCounter</code> from assignment 78 to the project of this
                    assignment!</p>

                    <p>Implement constructor and method <code>tick</code> for the class <code>Clock</code>. Use the
                    following main to test your clock:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Clock clock = new Clock(23, 59, 50);

        int i = 0;
        while( i &lt; 20) {
            System.out.println( clock );
            clock.tick();
            i++;
        }
    }

            <h3>A list of objects within an object</h3>

            <p>Let's expand the <code>WeightWatchersAssociation</code> object so that the association records all
            its members into an <code>ArrayList</code> object. So in this case the list will be filled with
            <code>Person</code> objects. In the extended version the association is given a name as a constructor
            parameter:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    private double lowestWeightIndex;
    private String name;
    private ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; members;

    public WeightWatchersAssociation(String name, double lowestWeightIndex) {
        this.lowestWeightIndex = lowestWeightIndex;
        this.name = name;
        this.members = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();
    }

    //..
}
</pre>

            <p>Let's create a method with which a person is added to the association. The method won't add
            anyone to the association but people with a high enough weight index. Let's also make a toString with
            which the members' names are printed:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public boolean isAccepted(Person person) {
        if ( person.weightIndex() &lt; this.lowestWeightIndex ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public void addAsMember(Person person) {
        if ( !isAccepted(person) ) { // same as isAccepted(person) == false
            return;
        }

        this.members.add(person);
    }

    public String toString() {
        String membersAsString = "";

        for ( Person member : this.members ) {
            membersAsString += "  " + member.getName() + "\n";
        }

        return "Weightwatchers association " + this.name + " members: \n" + membersAsString;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>The method <code>addAsMember</code> uses the method <code>isAccepted</code> that was creater
            earlier.</p>

            <p>Let's try out the expanded weightwatchers association:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeightWatchersAssociation weightWatcher = new WeightWatchersAssociation("Kumpulan paino", 25);

        Person matti = new Person("Matti");
        matti.setWeight(86);
        matti.setHeight(180);
        weightWatcher.addAsMember(matti);

        Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");
        juhana.setWeight(64);
        juhana.setHeight(172);
        weightWatcher.addAsMember(juhana);

        Person harri = new Person("Harri");
        harri.setWeight(104);
        harri.setHeight(182);

        petri.setHeight(173);
        weightWatcher.addAsMember(petri);

        System.out.println( weightWatcher );
}
</pre>

            <p>In the output we can see that Juhana wasn't accepted as a member:</p>

            <h3>Method returns an object</h3>

            <p>We've seen methods that return booleans, numbers, lists and strings. It's easy to guess that a
            method can return any type of an object. Let's make a method for the weight watchers association that
            returns the person with the highest weight index.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class WeightWatchersAssociation {
    // ...

    public Person personWithHighestWeightIndex() {
        // if members list is empty, we'll return null-reference
        if ( this.members.isEmpty() ) {
            return null;
        }

        Person heaviestSoFar = this.members.get(0);

        for ( Person person : this.members) {
            if ( person.weightIndex() &gt; heaviestSoFar.weightIndex() ) {
                heaviestSoFar = person;
            }
        }

        return heaviestSoFar;
    }
</pre>

            <p>The logic in this method works in the same way as when finding the largest number in a list. We use a
            dummy variable <code>heaviestSoFar</code> which is initially made to refer to the first person on the list.
            After that the list is read through and we see if there's anyone with a greater weight index in it, if
            so, we make <code>heaviestSoFar</code> refer to that one instead. At the end we return the value of the
            dummy variable, or in other words the <i>reference to a person object</i>.</p>

            <p>Let's make an expansion to the previous main program. The main program receives the reference
            returned by the method to its variable <code>heaviest</code>.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeightWatchersAssociation weightWatcher = new
WeightWatchersAssociation("Kumpluan paino", 25);

        // ..

        Person heaviest = weightWatcher.personWithHighestWeightIndex();
        System.out.print("member with the greatest weight index: " + heaviest.getName() );
        System.out.println(" weight index " + String.format( "%.2f", heaviest.weightIndex() ) );
}
</pre>

            <p>Prints:</p>

<pre>
member with the greatest weight index: Petri
weight index 37,42
</pre>

            <h3>Method returns an object it creates</h3>

            <p>In the last example a method returned one Person object that the WeightWatcers object had in it.
            It's also possible that a method returns an entirely new object. In the following is a simple counter
            that has a method <code>clone</code> with which a clone - an entirely new counter object - can be made from
            the counter, which at creation has the same value as the counter that is being cloned:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public Counter {
  private int value;

  public Counter(){
     this(0);
  }

  public Counter(int initialValue){
     this.value = initialValue;
  }

  public void grow(){
     this.value++;
  }

  public String toString(){
     return "value: "+value;
  }

  public Counter clone(){
     // lets create a new counter object, that gets as its initial value the value of the counter that is being cloned
     Counter clone = new Counter(this.value);

     // return the clone to the caller
     return clone;
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>Here's a usage example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Counter counter = new Counter();
  counter.grow();
  counter.grow();

  System.out.println(counter);         // prints 2

  Counter clone = counter.clone();

  System.out.println(counter);         // prints 2
  System.out.println(clone);           // prints 2

  counter.grow();
  counter.grow();
  counter.grow();
  counter.grow();

  System.out.println(counter);         // prints 6
  System.out.println(clone);           // prints 2

  clone.grow();

  System.out.println(counter);         // prints 6
  System.out.println(clone);           // prints 3
</pre>

            <p>The value of the object being cloned and the value of the clone - after the cloning has happened - are
            the same. However they are two different objects, so in the future as one of the counters grows the value
            of the other isn't affected in any way.</p>

        this.year = year;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;

    public boolean earlier(MyDate compared) {

}
</pre>

                    <h4 class="req">Next day</h4>

                    <p>Add to the class MyDate the method <code>public void advance()</code> that advances the date by
                    one. <strong>Note:</strong> In this assignment we assume that all the months have 30 days!</p>

                    <h4 class="req">Advancing many days</h4>

                    <p>Add also overloaded version <code>public void advance(int numberOfDays)</code>. This method
                    should advance the day by the number given as parameter. Implement this method so that it calls the
                    method <code>advance()</code> that was defined in the previous part of the assignment, e.g. the
                    call <code>advance(5)</code> should call <code>advance()</code> 5 times. Again assume that all the
                    months have 30 days!</p>

                    <h4 class="req">Creation of a new date</h4>

                    <p>Add to the class <code>MyDate</code> the method <code>MyDate afterNumberOfDays(int days)</code>,
                    that returns a <strong>new</strong> <code>MyDate</code>-object that has the date which equals the
                    date of the object for which the method was called advance by the parameter of the method
                    <code>days</code>. Again assume that all the months have 30 days!</p>

                    <p>Note that the object for which this method is called should not change!</p>

                    <p>Since the method creates a <b>new object</b>, the skeleton is of the form:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public MyDate afterNumberOfDays(int days){
        MyDate newMyDate = new MyDate( ... );

        // some code here

        return newMyDate;
    }

</pre>

                    <p>The following code</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDate day = new MyDate(25, 2, 2011);
        MyDate newDate = day.afterNumberOfDays(7);
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 7; ++i) {

            <h3>More assignments</h3>

            <p>All the new theory for this week has already been covered. However, since this week's topics are

                    <h3>Difference of two dates</h3>

                    <p>In this assignment we'll further extend the class MyDate. This assignment does not depend on
                    the previous one, so the project contains the MyDate class that does not have the extensions of the

                    called and the object given as parameters.</p>

                    <p><b>Note the following</b></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>the first vesion of the method is not very precise, it only calculates the difference of
                        the years and does not take into account the day and month of the dates</li>

                        <li>The method needs to work only in the case where the date given as parameter is before the
                        date for which the method is called</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>With the code</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

                    <h4 class="req">More accuracy</h4>

                    <p>Calculation of the previous version was not very exact, e.g. the difference of dates 1.1.2011

                    would be 1 year and 364 days, only the full years are counted and the result is thus one.</p>

                    <p>The method still needs to work only in the case where the date given as parameter is before the
                    date for which the method is called</p>

                    <p>The output for the previous example is now:</p>

                    <p>In chapter 24.9. Person was extended by adding to it a birthday represented as a MyDate object.
                    It was noticed that after the addition the instance variable <code>age</code> has no role since the
                    age could easily be calculated based on the current date and the birthday.</p>

                    <p>Now implement the method <code>age</code> that calucates and returns the age of the person.</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> in the previous assignment we added the class <code>MyDate</code> method
                    <code>public int differenceInYears(MyDate compared)</code>. Copy the method here since it eases

                    <h3>PhoneBook</h3>

                    <p>In this assignment we are implementing a simple phone book.</p>

                    <h4>Person</h4>

                    <p>Start by programing the class <code>Person</code> which works as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pekka = new Person("Pekka Mikkola", "040-123123");

    System.out.prinln( pekka.getName() );
    System.out.prinln( pekka.getNumber() );

    pekka.changeNumber("050-333444");
    System.out.println( pekka );
}
</pre>

                    <p>The output is:</p>

<pre>
Pekka Mikkola
040-123123
Pekka Mikkola  number: 040-123123
Pekka Mikkola  number: 050-333444
</pre>

                    <p>So you have to implement the following class:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>the method <code>public String toString()</code>, which returns the string representation
                        formulated as the above example shows</li>

                        <li>constructor that sets the person name and phone number</li>

                        <li><code>public String getName()</code>, that returns the name</li>

                        <li><code>public String getNumber()</code>, that returns the phone number</li>

                        <li>the method <code>public void changeNumber(String newNumber)</code>, that can be used to
                        change the phone number of the person</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Adding persons to Phonebook</h4>

                    <p>Program the class <code>Phonebook</code> that stores <code>Person</code>-objects using an
                    ArrayList. At this stage you'll need the following methods:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>public void add(String name, String number)</code> creates a
                        <code>Person</code>-object and adds it to the ArrayList inside the Phonebook</li>

                        <li><code>public void printAll()</code>, prints all the persons inside the Phonebook</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>With the code:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Phonebook phonebook = new Phonebook();

    phonebook.add("Pekka Mikkola", "040-123123");
    phonebook.add("Edsger Dijkstra", "045-456123");
    phonebook.add("Donald Knuth", "050-222333");

    phonebook.printAll();
</pre>

                    <p>the output should be:</p>

<pre>
Pekka Mikkola  number: 040-123123
Edsger Dijkstra  number: 045-456123
Donald Knuth  number: 050-222333
</pre>

                    <h4>Searching for numbers from the phonebooks</h4>

                    <p>Extend the class Phonebook with the method <code>public String searchNumber(String name)</code>,
                    that returns the phone number corresponding to the given name. If the sought person is not known
                    the string "number not known" is returned.</p>

                    <p>Example code:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Phonebook phonebook = new Phonebook();
    phonebook.add("Pekka Mikkola", "040-123123");
    phonebook.add("Edsger Dijkstra", "045-456123");
    phonebook.add("Donald Knuth", "050-222333");

    String number = phonebook.searchNumber("Pekka Mikkola");
    System.out.println( number );

    number = phonebook.searchNumber("Martti Tienari");
    System.out.println( number );
</pre>

                    <p>output:</p>

                    <h3>Money</h3>

                    <p>In a previous assignment we stored the balance of a LyyraCard using a double variable. In reality
                    money should not be represented as a double since the double arithmetics is not accurate. A better
                    idea would be to implement a class that represents money. We'll start with the folowing 
                    class skeleton:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Money {

    private final int euros;
    private final int cents;

    public Money(int euros, int cents) {
        this.euros = euros;
        this.cents = cents;
    }

    public int euros(){
        return euros;
    }

    public int cents(){
        return cents;
    }

    public String toString() {
        String zero = "";
        if (cents &lt;= 10) {
            zero = "0";
        }

        return euros + "." + zero + cents + "e";
    }
}
</pre>

                    <p>Notice that the instance variables <code>euros</code> and <code>cents</code> have been defined
                    as <code>final</code> meaning that once the variables have been set, the value of those can not be
                    chaged. An object value of which can not be changed is said to be <em>immutable</em>. If we need to
                    e.g. calculate the sum of two money objects, we need to create a new money object that represents
                    the sum of the originals.</p>

                    <p>In the following we'll create three methods that are needed in operating with money.</p>

                    <h4>Plus</h4>

                    <p>Let us start by implementing the method <code>public Money plus(Money added)</code>, that
                    returns a <em>new Money ohject</em> that has a value equal to the sum of the object for which the
                    method was called and the object given as parameter.</p>

                    <p>Examples of the method usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Money a = new Money(10,0);
  Money b = new Money(5,0);

  Money c = a.plus(b);

  System.out.println(a);  // 10.00e
  System.out.println(b);  // 5.00e
  System.out.println(c);  // 15.00e

  a = a.plus(c);          // NOTE: new Money-object is created and reference to that is assigned to variable a
                          //       the Money object 10.00e that variable a used to hold, is not referenced anymore

  System.out.println(a);  // 25.00e
  System.out.println(b);  // 5.00e
  System.out.println(c);  // 15.00e
</pre>

                    <h4>less</h4>

                    <p>Create the method <code>public boolean less(Money compared)</code>, that returns true if the
                    object for which the method was called is less valuable than the object given as parameter.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Money a = new Money(10,0);
  Money b = new Money(3,0);
  Money c = new Money(5,0);

  System.out.println(a.less(b));  // false
  System.out.println(b.less(c));  // true

</pre>

                    <h4>Minus</h4>

                    <p>And finally create the method <code>public Money minus(Money decremented)</code>, that returns a
                    <em>new Money ohject</em> that has a value equal to the object for which the method was called
                    minus the object given as parameter. If the value would be negative, the resulting Money object
                    should have the value 0.</p>

                    <p>Examples of the method usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  Money a = new Money(10,0);
  Money b = new Money(3,5);

  Money c = a.minus(b);

  System.out.println(a);  // 10.00e
  System.out.println(b);  // 3.50e
  System.out.println(c);  // 6.50e

  c = c.minus(a);        // NOTE: new Money-object is created and reference to that is assigned to variable c
                          //       the Money object 6.50e that variable c used to hold, is not referenced anymore

  System.out.println(a);  // 10.00e
  System.out.println(b);  // 3.50e
  System.out.println(c);  // 0.00e
</pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Character strings are immutable</h3>

            <p>The String objects of Java, as with the Money class objects, are unchangeable, <em>immutable</em>.
            If for example a new object is concatenated to the end of a character string with the + operator, the
            original character string doesn't become longer, but a new character string object is born:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String characterString = "test";
characterString + "tail";

System.out.println( characterString );  // test
</pre>

            <p>We see that the character string cannot be changed, but we can add the value of the new character string
            - that was born from concatenation - to the old variable:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String characterString = "test";
characterString = characterString + "tail";   // or characterString += "tail";

System.out.println( characterString );  // testtail
</pre><!--
Despite the ease of use of ArrayList the programs you write sometimes have a need for a <em>List</em>, the ancestor of ArrayList.
-->

            <p>Now the variable <code>characterString</code> refers to a <em>new</em> character string object, which
            was created by combining the previous character string value the variable referred to ("test")
            with the "tail" character string. Nothing refers to the "test" character string object
            anymore.</p>

            <h2 id="taulukko">Array</h2>

            <p>During the course, we've used ArrayLists numerous times to store different kinds of objects.
            ArrayList is easy to use because it offers a lot of ready-made tools that make the programmer's life a
            little easier: automatic growing of a list, thanks to which the list doesn't run out of space (unless
            of course the list grows so large that it makes the program take up all the memory that is reserved for
            it), for example.</p>

            <p><em>Array</em> is an object that can be understood as a serie of <em>pigeonholes</em> for values. The
            <em>length</em> or <em>size</em> of an array is the number of spots in that array - the number of items you
            can put in the array. The values of an array are called <em>cells</em> of the array. Unlike with
            ArrayLists, the size of the array (the amount of cells in an array) cannot be changed, growing an array
            always requires creating a new array and copying the cells of the old array to the new one.</p>

            <p>An array can be created in two ways. Let's take a look at the way in which we give content to the array
            at creation. An array of the integer type that consists of 3 cells is defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {100, 1, 42};
</pre>

            <p>The type of the Array object is denoted as<code>int[]</code>, which stands for an array, the cells of which
             are of the type <code>int</code>. In the example the name of the array-object is <code>numbers</code>
            and it holds 3 number values <code>{100, 1, 42}</code>. The array is formatted with a block, in which the
            values to be inserted into the array are separated by commas.</p>

            <p>The values of the array can be of any variable type that we've seen earlier. Below we've first
            introduced an array containing character strings and then an array containing floating numbers.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
String[] characterStringArray = {"Matti P.", "Matti V."};
double[] floatingNumberArray = {1.20, 3.14, 100.0, 0.6666666667};
</pre>

            <p>The cells of the array are referred to with <em>indexes</em> that are integers. The index tells the
            position of the cell in the array. The first item in an array is in position 0, the next one in position 1, and
            so forth. When inspecting a certain value of an array, the index is given after the name of the array
            object in brackets.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
// index           0   1    2    3   4   5     6     7
int[] numbers = {100,  1,  42,  23,  1,  1, 3200, 3201};

System.out.println(numbers[0]);    // prints the number in the array's index 0: the number 100
System.out.println(numbers[2]);    // prints the number in the array's index 2, the number 42
</pre>

            <p>The size (length) of the array above is 8.</p>

            <p><em>You'll probably notice that the <code>get</code>-method of ArrayList works pretty much the same
            as getting from a certain index of an array. Only the notation - the syntax - is different when dealing
            with arrays.</em></p>

            <p>Setting an individual value to a certain position in an array happens the same way as with regular
            variables, only with arrays the index also has to be mentioned. The index is mentioned inside brackets.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {100,1,42};

numbers[0] = 1;    // setting value 1 to index 0
numbers[1] = 101;  // setting value 101 to index 1

// the numbers array now looks like {1,101,42}
</pre>

            <p>If an index points <em>past an array</em>, that is, to a cell that doesn't exist, we will get an
            error: <em>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</em>, which means that the index that we pointed at doesn't
            exist. So we cannot refer to a cell that is past the array - to an index that is smaller than 0, or larger
            or equals the size of the array.</p>

            <p>We'll notice that the array clearly is related to ArrayList. As with lists, also in arrays the
            cells are in a certain place within them!</p>

            <h3>Iteration of an array</h3>

            <p>The size of an array object can be found out by typing <code>array.length</code> into the code, notice
            that you don't use parentheses with this one. <code>array.length()</code> does not work!</p>

            <p>Iterating through the cells of an array is easy to implement with the help of the
            <code>while</code>-command:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {1, 8, 10, 3, 5};

int i = 0;
while (i &lt; numbers.length ) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
    i++;
}
</pre>

            <p>With the help of variable <code>i</code> we go through the indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and print the
            value of the variable in each cell. First <code>numbers[0]</code> gets printed, then
            <code>numbers[1]</code> and so forth. The variable <code>i</code> stops getting increased when the array has
            been iterated through, that is when <code>i</code>'s value is equal to the length of the array.</p>

            <p>When iterating through an array it isn't always necessary to list the indexes of it, the only
            interesting thing is the values of the array. In this case we can use the for-each-structure - that we
            became familiar with earlier - to go through the values. Now only the name of a variable is given in the
            frame of the loop, to which each of the values of the array are set one after the other. The name of the
            array is separated with a colon.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {1,8,10,3,5};

for (int number : numbers) {
  System.out.println(number);
}
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
String[] names = {"Juhana L.", "Matti P.", "Matti L.", "Pekka M."};

for (String name : names) {
  System.out.println(name);
}
</pre>

            <p><strong>Notice:</strong> when using a for-each-type of loop you cannot set values to the cells of the
            array! With the format of the for-sentence we inspect next that can be done too.</p>

            <h3>Another form of the for command</h3>

            <p>So far when doing loops, we've used while and the for-each form of the for sentence. Another form of
            the for-loop exists, which is handy especially when handling arrays. In the following we print the numbers
            0, 1 and 2 with a for loop:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ ) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
</pre>

            <p>The for in the example works <em>exactly</em> as the while below:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int i = 0;  // formatting the variable that will be used in the loop
while ( i &lt; 3 ) {  // condition
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;   // updating the variable that is used in the loop
}
</pre>

            <p>a for command, as shown in <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++ )</code> above, has three parts to it:
            <em>formatting the loop variables; condition; updating the loop variables</em>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>In the first part, the variables that are used in the loop are formatted. In the example above we
                formatted the variable <code>i</code> with <code>int i=0</code>. The first part is run only once, at
                the beginning of a for run.</li>

                <li>In the second part the condition is defined, which defines how long the code is run in the code
                block that is related to the for loop. In our example the condition was <code>i &lt; 3</code>. The
                validity of the condition is checked <em>before each round of the loop</em>. The condition works
                exactly the same as the a condition of a while loop works.</li>

                <li>The third part, which in our example is <code>i++</code> , is always run once at the end of each
                round of the loop.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Compared to <em>while</em>, <em>for</em> is a slightly clearer way of implementing loops of whose
            amount of runs is based on, for example, growing a counter. When going through an array the case is usually
            exactly this. In the following we print the contents of the <code>numbers</code> array with for:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105};

for(int i = 3; i &lt; 7; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
</pre>

            <p>Naturally with for you don't have to start from 0 and the iteration can be done 'from top
            down'. For example, the cells in indexes 6, 5, 4, and 3 can be printed like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105};

for(int i = 6; i&gt;2 ; i--) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
</pre>

            <h3>For and array length</h3>

            <p>Going through all cells of an array with for happens like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] numbers = {1, 8, 10, 3, 5};

for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++ ) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
</pre>

            <p>Notice, that in the condition <code>i &lt; numbers.length</code> we compare the value of the
            loop variable to the length we get from the array. The condition should not in any case be
            "hardcoded" as, for example, <code>i &lt; 5</code> because often the length of the array
            can't be known for sure beforehand.</p>

            <h3>Array as a parameter</h3>

            <p>Arrays can be used - just as any other objects - as a parameters to a method. Notice that, as with all
            objects, the method gets a reference to an array, so all changes done to the content of the array in the
            method also show up in the main program.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void listCells(int[] integerArray) {

  System.out.println("the cells of the array are: ");
  for( int number : integerArray) {
    System.out.print(number + " "); 
  }

  System.out.println("");
}

public static void  main(String[] args) {
  int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  listCells(numbers);
}
</pre>

            <p>As we already know, the name of the parameter within a method can be freely chosen. The name does not
            need to be the same as in the one used in calling it. Above, the array is called <code>integerArray</code>
            within the method and the caller of the method knows the array as <code>numbers</code>.

            <h3>Creating a new array</h3>

            <p>If the size of the array isn't always the same, that is, if its size depends on 
            user input for example, the previously introduced way of creating arrays will not do. It is also possible to create a
            table so that its size is defined with the help of a variable:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int cells = 99;
int[] array = new int[cells];
</pre>

            <p>Above we create an array of the type int, that has 99 cells. With this alternative way creation of an
            array happens just like with any other object; with the command <code>new</code>. Following the
            <code>new</code> is the type of the array and in the brackets is the size of the array.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int cells = 99;
int[] array = new int[cells]; //creating an array of the size of the value in the 'cells' variable

if(array.length == cells) {
    System.out.println("The length of the array is " + cells);
} else {
    System.out.println("Something unreal happened. The length of the array is something else than " + cells);
}
</pre>

            <p>In the following example there is a program that prompts for the user the amount of values and subsequently
            the values. After this the program prints the values in the same order again. The values given by the user
            are stored in the array.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
System.out.print("How many values? ");
int amountOfValues = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

int[] values = new int[amountOfValues];

System.out.println("Enter values:");
for(int i = 0; i &lt; amountOfValues; i++) {
    values[i] = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
}

System.out.println("Values again:");
for(int i = 0; i &lt; amountOfValues; i++) {
    System.out.println(values[i]);
}
</pre>

            <p>A run of the program could look something like this:</p>

<pre>
How many values? <span class="red">4</span>
Enter values:
<span class="red">4</span>
<span class="red">8</span>
<span class="red">2</span>
<span class="red">1</span>
Values again:
4
2
8
1

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public static int[] copy(int[] array)</code> that creates a copy of

                    method should create a new array where the contents of the parameter is copied.</p>

                    <p>In the following an example of the usage (note how code uses a handy helper method to print
                    arrays):</p>

            <h2 id="lohkoista">About blocks and nested loops</h2>

            <p>A piece of code that begins with a curly bracket <code>{</code> and ends with a curly bracket
            <code>}</code> is called a <em>block</em>. As we've already seen, blocks are used - among other things
            - to denote the code of conditional and loop sentences. <em>An important feature of a block is that
            variables defined within it only exist within it.</em>.</p>

            <p>In the following example we define the string variable <code>stringDefinedWithinBlock</code> within the
            block of a conditional sentence, which therefor will only exist within the block. The variable introduced
            within the block cannot be printed outside of it!</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 5;

if( number == 5 ){
  String stringDefinedWithinBlock = "Yeah!";
}

System.out.println(stringDefinedWithinBlock); // does not work!
</pre>

            <p>However, you can use and manipulate variables defined outside of the block in the block.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int number = 5;

if( number == 5 ) {
  number = 6;
}

System.out.println(number); // prints 6
</pre>

            <p>You can have any kind of code within a block. For example, a for loop can have another for loop within it
            or say, a while loop. Let's inspect the following program:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
   System.out.print(i + ": ");

   for(int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
      System.out.print(j + " ");      
   }

   System.out.println();
}
</pre>

            <p>The program prints the following:</p>

<pre>
0: 0 1 2
1: 0 1 2
2: 0 1 2
</pre>

            <p>So what happens in the program? If we only think about the outer for loop, its functionality is
            easy to understand:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
   System.out.print(i + ": ");

   // the inner for-loop

   System.out.println();
}
</pre>

            <p>So first <code>i=0</code> prints <code>0:</code> and a carriage return. After this i grows and 1 is
            printed and so forth, so the outer for makes this happen:</p>

<pre>
0:
1:
2:
</pre>

            <p>The inner for loop is also easy to understand separately. It prints out <code>0 1 2</code>. When we
            combine these two, we'll notice that the inner for loop carries out its print just before the
            outer for loop's carriage return.</p>

            <h3>variables defined outside of a for loop as its condition</h3>

            <p>Let's inspect the following alteration to the previous example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
   System.out.print(i + ": ");

   for(int j = 0; j &lt;= i; j++) {
      System.out.print(j + " ");      
   }

   System.out.println();
}
</pre>

            <p>The amount of runs the inner for loop does now depends on the value of the variable <code>i</code> of
            the outer loop. So when <code>i=0</code> the inner loop prints 0, when <code>i=1</code> the inner loop
            prints 0 1. The entire output of the program is as follows:</p>

<pre>
0: 0
1: 0 1
2: 0 1 2
</pre>

            <p>The following program prints out the multiplication tables of the numbers 1 .. 10.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
for(int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {

    for(int j = 1; j &lt;= 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(i * j + " ");
    }

    System.out.println();
}
</pre>

            <p>The output looks like this:</p>

<pre>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
</pre>

            <p>The topmost row has the multiplication table of 1. At the beginning <code>i=1</code> and the inner
            loop's variable <code>j</code> gets the values 1...10. For each <code>i, j</code> value pair their
            product is printed. So at the beginning <code>i=1, j=1</code>, then <code>i=1, j=2</code>, ..., <code>i=1,
            j=10</code> next <code>i=2, j=1</code>, and so forth.</p>

            <p>Of course the multiplication table program can be cut in to smaller pieces, too. We can define the
            methods <code>public void printMultiplicationTableRow(int multiplier, int howManyTimes)</code> and
            <code>public void printMultiplicationTable(int upTo)</code>, in this case the structure of our program
            could be as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class MultiplicationTable {

  public void print(int upTo) {
    for(int i = 1; i &lt;= upTo; i++) {
      printMultiplicationTableRow(i, upTo);

      System.out.println();
    }
  }

  public void printMultiplicationTableRow(int multiplier, int howManyTimes) {
    for(int i = 1; j &lt;= howManyTimes; i++) {
        System.out.print(i * multiplier + " ");
    }
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>Now calling <code>new MultiplicationTable().print(5);</code> prints the tables below.</p>

<pre>
1 2 3 4 5   
2 4 6 8 10  
3 6 9 12 15 
4 8 12 16 20
5 10 15 20 25
</pre>

            <div class="tehtavat">
                <div class="tehtava">
                    <h3>Array to stars</h3>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public static printArrayAsStars(int[] array)</code>, which prints a

                    <p><strong>Note!</strong> in the assignment use the <code>for</code>-clause. Despite that the
                    previous chapter described nested loops, in this assignment we "hide" the nested loop
                    within a method.</p>

                    <h4>Class NightSky and a star line</h4>

                    <p>Create the class <code>NightSky</code>, that has three object variables: density
                    (<code>double</code>), width (<code>int</code>), and height (<code>int</code>). The class should
                    have 3 constructors:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>public NightSky(double density)</code> creates a NightSky object with the given star
                        density. Width gets the value <code>20</code> and height the value <code>10</code>.</li>

                        <li><code>public NightSky(int width, int height)</code> creates a NightSky object with the
                        given width and height. Density gets the value <code>0.1</code>.</li>

                        <li><code>public NightSky(double density, int width, int height)</code> creates a
                        NightSky-object with the given density, width and height</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Add the class <code>NightSky</code> the method <code>printLine</code>, that prints one line of
                    starts. The line length is determined by the value of the instance variable <code>width</code> and
                    the instance variable <code>density</code> determines the star propability. For each printed
                    character you should use a <code>Random</code> object to decide if it prints out as a white space
                    or a star. The method <code>nextDouble</code> is propably of the use now.</p>

                    <p>In the following an exampe:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(0.1, 40, 10);
    NightSky.printLine();

                    <h4>Printing the night sky</h4>

                    <p>Add the class <code>NightSky</code> the method <code>print</code>, that prints the night sky of
                    the given size. Use the method <code>printLine</code> to print each separate line of the night sky.
                    An example in the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(8, 4);
    NightSky.print();
</pre>

<pre>
    *   

  *     
    *

                    <h4>Counting the number of the stars</h4>

                    <p>Add the class <code>NightSky</code> an instance variable starsInLastPrint (<code>int</code>) and
                    the method <code>starsInLastPrint()</code>, that returns the number of stars printed in the
                    previous night sky. Example in the below:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    NightSky NightSky = new NightSky(8, 4);
    NightSky.print();

            <h2>to static or not to static?</h2>

            <p>When we started using objects, the material adviced to leave out the keyword 'static' when
            defining their methods. However, up until week 3 all of the methods had the keyword in them. So what is it
            all about?</p>

            <p>The following example has a method <code>resetArray</code>, that works as its name implies; it sets
            all of the cells of an array that it receives as a parameter to 0.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Program {

  public static void resetArray(int[] taulukko) {
    for ( int i=0; i &lt; taulukko.length; i++ )
      taulukko[i] = 0;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    for ( int luku : values ) {
      System.out.print( luku + " " );  // tulostuu 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }

    System.out.println();

    resetArray(t);

    for ( int luku : values ) {
      System.out.print( luku + " " );  // tulostuu 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    }
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>We notice that the method definition now has the keyword <code>static</code>. The reason for that is
            that the method does not operate on any object, instead it is a <em>class method</em> or in other words
            <em>static methods</em>. In contrast to instance methods, static methods are not connected to any
            particular object and thus the reference <code>this</code> is not valid within static methods. A static
            method can operate only with data that is given it as parameter. The parameter of a static method can
            naturally be an object.</p>

            <p>Since static methods are not connected to any object, those can not be called through the object name:
            <code>objectName.methodName()</code> but should be called as in the above example by using only the method
            name.</p>

            <p>If the static method is called from a different class, the call is of the form
            <code>ClassName.staticMethodName()</code>. The below example demonstrates that:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Program {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    for ( int value : values ) {
      System.out.print( value + " " );  // prints: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    }

    System.out.println();

    ArrayHandling.resetArray(values);

    for ( int value : values ) {
      System.out.print( luku + " " );  // prints: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class ArrayHandling {
  public static void resetArray(int[] array) {
    for ( int i=0; i &lt; array.length; i++ ) {
      array[i] = 0;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

            <p>The static method that has been defined within another class will now be called with
            <code>ArrayHandling.resetArray(<em>parameter</em>);</code>.</p>

            <h3>When static methods should be used</h3>

            <p>All object state-handling methods should be defined as normal object methods. For example, all of the
            methods of the <code>Person, MyDate, Clock, Team, ...</code> classes we defined during the previous weeks
            should be defined as normal object methods, not as statics.</p>

            <p>Lets get back to the <code>Person</code> class yet again. In the following is a part of the class
            definition. All of the object variables are referred to with the <code>this</code> keyword because we
            emphasize that we are handling the object variables 'within' the said object..</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.age = 0;
        this.name = name;      
    }

    public boolean isAdult(){
        if ( this.age &lt; 18 ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}

            <p>Because the methods manipulate the object, they do not need to be defined as static, or in other words
            "not belonging to the object". If we try to do this, the program won't work:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Person {
    //...

    public static void becomeOlder() {
        this.age++;
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>As a result we'll get an error <i>non-static variable age can not be referenced from static
            context</i>, which means that a static method cannot handle an object method.</p>

            <p>So when should a static method be used then? Let us inspect the Person object handling an example familiar
            from chapter 23:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person antti = new Person("Antti");
        Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");

        for ( int i=0; i &lt; 30; i++ ) {
            pekka.becomeOlder();
            juhana.becomeOlder();
        }

        antti.becomeOlder();

        if ( antti.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.println( antti.getName() + " is an adult" );
        } else {
            System.out.println( antti.getName() + " is a minor" );
        }

        if ( pekka.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.println( pekka.getName() + " is an adult" );
        } else {
            System.out.println( pekka.getName() + " is a minor" );
        }

        if ( juhana.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is an adult" );
        } else {
            System.out.println( juhana.getName() + " is a minor" );
        }
    }
}
</pre>

            <p>We'll notice that the piece of code that reports the matureness of persons is copy-pasted twice in
            the program. It looks really bad!</p>

            <p>Reporting the maturity of a person is an excellent candidate for a static method. Let's rewrite the
            Program using that method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person pekka = new Person("Pekka");
        Person antti = new Person("Antti");
        Person juhana = new Person("Juhana");

        for ( int i=0; i &lt; 30; i++ ) {
            pekka.becomeOlder();
            juhana.becomeOlder();
        }

        antti.becomeOlder();

        reportMaturity(antti);

        reportMaturity(pekka);

        reportMaturity(juhana);
    }

    private static void reportMaturity(Person person) {
        if ( henkilo.isAdult() ) {
            System.out.println(person.getName() + " is an adult");
        } else {
            System.out.println(person.getName() + " is a minor");
        }
    }
}       
</pre>

            <p>The method <code>reportMaturity</code> is defined as static so it doesn't belong to any object,
            <strong>but</strong> the method receives a Person object as a parameter. The method is not defined within
            the Person-class since even though it handles a Person object that it receives as a paramter, it is an
            assistance method of the main program we just wrote. With the method we've made main more readable.</p>

                    <h3>The library information system</h3>

                    <p>In this assignment we are implementing a simple information system prototype for a library. The
                    prototype will have functionality for searching books by the title, publisher or publishing
                    year.</p>

                    <p>The main building blocks of the system are the classes <code>Book</code> and
                    <code>Library</code>. Objects of the class <code>Book</code> represent the information of a sigle
                    book. Object of the class <code>Library</code> holds a set of books and provides various ways to
                    search for the books within the library.</p>

                    <h4>Book</h4>

                    <p>Let us start with the class Book. The class has instance variables <code>title</code> for the
                    book title, <code>publisher</code> for the name of the publisher, and <code>year</code>
                    for the publishing year. The title and the publisher are of the type String and the publishing year
                    is represented as an integer.</p>

                    <p>Now implement the class <code>Book</code>. The class should have the constructor <code>public
                    Book(String title, String publisher, int year)</code> and methods <code>public String
                    title()</code>, <code>public String publisher()</code>, <code>public int year()</code> and
                    <code>public String toString()</code>.</p>

                    <p>Example usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
Book cheese = new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007);
System.out.println(cheese.title());
System.out.println(cheese.publisher());
System.out.println(cheese.year());

System.out.println(cheese);
</pre>

                    <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
Cheese Problems Solved
Woodhead Publishing
2007
Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
</pre>

                    <h4>Library</h4>

                    <p>Implement the class <code>Library</code>, with constructor <code>public Library()</code> and
                    methods <code>public void addBook(Book newBook)</code> and <code>public void
                    printBooks()</code></p>

                    <p>Example usage below.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
Library Library = new Library();

Book cheese = new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007);
Library.addBook(cheese);

Book nhl = new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952);
Library.addBook(nhl);

Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));

Library.printBooks();
</pre>

                    <p>The output should be:</p>

<pre>
Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
NHL Hockey, Stanley Kupp, 1952
Battle Axes, Tom A. Hawk, 1851
</pre>

                    <h4>Search functionality</h4>

                    <p>Add to the class <code>Library</code> the methods <code>public ArrayList&lt;Book&gt;
                    searchByTitle(String title)</code>, <code>public ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; searchByPublisher(String
                    publisher)</code> and <code>public ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; searchByYear(int year)</code>. The methods
                    return the list of books that match the given title, publisher or year.</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> you are supposed to do a method that returns an ArrayList. Use the following
                    skeleton as starting point:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Library {
   // ...

   public ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; searchByTitle(String title) {
     ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; found = new ArrayList&lt;Book&gt;

     // iterate the list of books and add all the matching books to the list found

     return found;  
   }
</pre>

                    <p>Note: when you do the search by a string (title or publisher), do not look for exact matches
                    (with the method <code>equals</code>) instead use the method <code>contains</code> of the class
                    <code>String</code>.</p>

                    <p>Example usage:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
Library Library = new Library();

Library.addBook(new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007));
Library.addBook(new Book("The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales", "Penguin Group", 1992));
Library.addBook(new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952));
Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));

ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; result = Library.searchByTitle("Cheese");
for (Book Book: result) {
    System.out.println(Book);
}

System.out.println("---");
for (Book Book: Library.searchByPublisher("Penguin Group  ")) {
    System.out.println(Book);
}

System.out.println("---");
for (Book Book: Library.searchByYear(1851)) {
    System.out.println(Book);
}
</pre>

                    <p>The output should be:</p>

</pre>

                    <h4>Improved search</h4>

                    <p>There are some minor problems with the implemented search functionality. One particular problem
                    is that the search differentiates upper and lower case letters. In the above example the search by
                    title with the search term <code>"cheese"</code> produced an empty list as answer. 
                    The example where the search term contained extra white spaces did not give the expected answer, either.
                    We'd like the search functionality to be case insensitive and not disturbed by the extra white
                    spaces at the start or at the end of the search terms. We will implement a small helper library
                    <code>StringUtils</code> that will then be used in the Library for the more flexible search
                    functionality.</p>

                    <p>Implement the class <code>StringUtils</code> with a <strong>static</strong> method <code>public
                    static boolean included(String word, String searched)</code>, which checks if the string
                    <code>searched</code> is contained within the string <code>searched</code>. As described in the
                    previous paragraph, the method should be case insensitive and should not care about trailing and
                    ending white spaces in the string <code>searched</code>. If either of the strings is <em>null</em>,
                    the method should return <code>false</code>.</p>

                    <p><em>Tip:</em> The methods <code>trim</code> and <code>toUpperCase()</code> of the class
                    <code>String</code> might be helpful.</p>

                    <p>When you have completed the method, use it in the search functionality of the class
                    <code>Library</code>.</p>

                    <p>Use the method as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
if(StringUtils.included(Book.title(), searchedTitle)) {
   // Book found!
}
</pre>

                    <p>The improved library with the example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
Library Library = new Library();

Library.addBook(new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007));
Library.addBook(new Book("The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales", "Penguin Group", 1992));
Library.addBook(new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952));
Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));

for (Book Book: Library.searchByTitle("CHEESE")) {
    System.out.println(Book);
}

System.out.println("---");
for (Book Book: Library.searchByPublisher("PENGUIN  ")) {
    System.out.println(Book);
}
</pre>

                    <p>should output the following:</p>

<pre>
Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, Penguin Group, 1992

                    <p><b>This assignment corresponds to three assignment points.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Note1:</b> Your program should use only one Scanner object, i.e., it is allowed to call
                    <code>new Scanner</code> only once. If you need scanner in multiple places, you can pass it as
                    parameter:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

     // ...

     doSomething(scanner);  
  }

  public static void doSomething(Scanner scanner) {
     String riw = scanner.nextLine();
     // ...
  }
</pre>

                    <p>If another object needs a scanner, you can pass it as constructor parameter and save in
                    instance variable.</p>

                    <p><b>Note2:</b> Do not save anything in static variables. The main method is executed by the tests
                    multiple times so the use of static variables might cause problems.</p>

                    <p>The input of the program is a set of exam scores of a course. Each score is an integer. When -1
                    is entered, the program stops asking for further input.</p>

                    <p>Inputting the exam scores should work as follows:</p>

<pre>
Type exam scores, -1 completes:
<font color="red">34</font>
<font color="red">41</font>
<font color="red">53</font>
<font color="red">36</font>
<font color="red">55</font>
<font color="red">27</font>
<font color="red">43</font>
<font color="red">40</font>
<font color="red">-1</font>
</pre>

                    <p>After the scores have been read, the program prints the grade distribution and acceptance
                    percentage of the course in the following form:</p>

<pre>
Grade distribution:
5: **
4:   
3: ***
2: *
1: *
0: *
Acceptance percentage: 87.5 
</pre>

                    <p>Grade distribution is formed as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each exam score is mapped to a grade using the same formula as in exercise 18. If the
                        score is not within the range 0-60 it is not taken into account.</li>

                        <li>The number of grades are printed as stars, e.g. if there are 2 scores that correspond to grade
                        5, the line <em>5: **</em> is printed. If there are no scores that correspond to a particular
                        grade, as is the case with grade 4 in the above example, the printed line is <em>4:</em></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>All the grades besides zeros are accepted, so in the above 7 out of 8 participants were
                    accepted. Acceptance percentage is calculated with the formula <em>100*accepted/allScores</em>.</p>

                    <p>In this assignment you are supposet to design and implement an observation database for a bird
                    watcher. The database contains birds, each of which have a name and a Latin name, both Strings.
                    Database also tracks how many times each bird has been observed.</p>

                    <p>The program should implement the following commands:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><code>Show</code> - prints one bird</li>

                        <li><code>Quit</code> - terminates the program</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The program should also handle the invalid inputs (see <code>Turing</code> below).</p>

            <h2>Sorting an array</h2>

            <p>We'll get back to arrays again.</p>

            <h3>Sorting an array with the ready-made tools of Java.</h3>

            <p>As we've seen, there's all kinds of useful things already in Java. For example for handling
            ArrayLists you can find many useful help methods in the class Collections. For arrays you can find helpful
            methods in the class <code>Arrays</code>. Sorting a table can be done with
            <code>Arrays.sort(array)</code>.</p>

            <p>Note: To be able to use the command you must have the following definition at the top of the program
            file:</p>

<pre>
import java.util.Arrays;
</pre>

            <p><em>If you forget to write the <code>import</code> line, NetBeans will offer help with writing it. Try
            clicking the picture of the "bulp" that appears to the left from the line of code that is underlined with
            red.</em></p>

            <p>The following program creates arrays and sorts the values in the array with the Arrays.sort
            -command.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    int[] values = {-3, -111, 7, 42};
    Arrays.sort(values);
    for(int value: values) {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
</pre>

-111
-3

42
</pre>

            <h3>Implementation of a sorting algorithm</h3>

            <p>It's easy to sort an array with the ready-made tools of Java. The general knowledge of a program
            requires knowing at least one sorting algorithm (or in other words, a way to sort an array). Let's get
            familiar with the "classic" sorting algorithm, choice sorting. Let's do this with a few
            excercise.</p>

int[] values = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
System.out.println("smallest: " + smallest(values));
</pre>

<pre>
smallest: 5
</pre>

                    <h4 class="req">The index of the smallest</h4>

                    <p>Implement a method <code>indexOfTheSmallest</code>, which returns the index of the smallest value
                    in the array (the position of the value in the array, that is).</p>

                    <p>The frame of the method looks like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static int indexOfTheSmallest(int[] array) {
    // code goes here
}
</pre>

                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> You can't change the array that gets passed into the method as a
                    parameter!</p>

                    <p>The following code demonstrates the functionality of the method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
// indexes:   0  1  2  3  4
int[] values = {6, 5, 8, 7, 11};
System.out.println("Index of the smallest: " + indexOfTheSmallest(values));
</pre>

<pre>
Index of the smallest: 1
</pre>

                    <p>The smallest value of the table is 2 and its index (its location) in the array is 1.
                    Remember that the numbering of an array begins from 0.</p>

                    <h4 class="req">Index of the smallest at the end of an array</h4>

                    <p>Implement a method <code>indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom</code>, which works just like the method of
                    the previous assignment, but only takes into consideration the end of an array starting from a
                    certain index. In addition to the array the method gets as parameter an index, from which the search for the
                    smallest will be started.</p>

                    <p>The frame of the method is as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static int indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(int[] array, int index) {
    // write the code here
}
</pre>

                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> You can't change the array that gets passed into the method as a
                    parameter!</p>

                    <p>The following code demonstrates the functionality of the method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
// indexes:    0  1  2  3   4
int[] values = {-1, 6, 9, 8, 12};
System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 1));
System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 2));
System.out.println(indexOfTheSmallestStartingFrom(values, 4));
</pre>

<pre>
1
3
4
</pre>

                    <p>In the example, the first method call finds the index of the smallest value starting from index
                    1. Starting from index 1 the smallest value is 6, and its index is 1. Respectively the second
                    method call looks for the index of the smallest value starting from index 2. In this case the
                    smallest value is 8 and its index is 3. The last call starts from the last cell of the
                    array, in this case there is no other cells so the smallets value is in index 4.</p>

                    <h4 class="req">Swapping values</h4>

                    <p>Create a method <code>swap</code>, to which will be passed an array and two of its indexes.
                    The method swaps the values in the indexes around.</p>

                    <p>The frame of the method looks like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void swap(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {
    // code goes here
}
</pre>

                    <p>The following showcases the functionality of the method. In printing the array we'll use the
                    Arrays.toString-method which formats the array into a string:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] values = {3, 2, 5, 4, 8};

System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );

swap(values, 1, 0);
System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );

swap(values, 0, 3);
System.out.println( Arrays.toString(values) );
</pre>

<pre>
[3, 2, 5, 4, 8]
[2, 3, 5, 4, 8]
[4, 3, 5, 2, 8]
</pre>

                    <h4 class="req">Sorting</h4>

                    <p>Now we've got a set of useful methods, with which we can implement a sorting algorithm known
                    as selection sorting.</p>

                    <p>The idea of selection sorting is this:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Move the smallest number of the array to index 0.</li>

                        <li>Move the second smallest number to the index 1.</li>

                        <li>Move the third smallest number to the index 2.</li>

                        <li>and so forth</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In other words:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Inspect the array starting from index 0. Swap the value in index 0 and the smallest value
                        in the array starting from index 0.</li>

                        <li>Inspect the array starting from index 1. Swap the value in index 1 and the smallest value
                        in the array starting from index 1.</li>

                        <li>Inspect the array starting from index 2. Swap the value in index 2 and the smallest value
                        in the array starting from index 2.</li>

                        <li>and so forth</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>sort</code>, which is based on the idea above. The method ought to
                    have a loop that goes through the indexes of the array. The methods
                    <code>smallestIndexStartingFrom</code> and <code>swap</code> are surely useful. Also print the
                    contents of the array before sorting and after each round to be able to make sure that the
                    algorithm works correctly.</p>

                    <p>Body of the method:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public static void sort(int[] array) {
}
</pre>

                    <p>Test the functionality of the method at least with this example:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
int[] values = {8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4};
sort(values);
</pre>

                    <p>The program should print the following. Notice that you're to print the content of the array
                    after each swap!</p>

<pre>
[8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4]
[1, 3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 7, 9, 8, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
</pre>

                    <p>You'll notice how the array little by little gets sorted out starting from the beginning and
                    advances towards the end.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Searching</h2>

            <p>In addition to sorting, another very typical problem that a programmer runs into is finding a certain
            value in an array. Earlier, we've implemented methods that search for values in lists and arrays. In
            the case of arrays, values and strings can be searched for in the following way:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
  public static boolean isInArray(int[] array, int searchingFor) {
    for ( int value : array ) {
       if ( value == searchingFor )  {
           return true;
       }
    }

    return false;
  }

  public static boolean isWordInArray(String[] array, String searchingFor) {
    for ( String word: array ) {
       if ( word.equals(searchingFor) )  {
           return true;
       }
    }

    return false;
  }
</pre>

            <p>An implementation like this is the best we've been able to do so far. The downside of the method is
            that, if the array has a very large amount of values in it, the search will take a lot of time. In the worst
            case scenario the method goes through every single cell in the array. This means that going through an
            array that has 16777216 cells does 16777216 cell inspections.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, if the values in an array are <i>ordered by size</i>, the search can be done in a
            notably faster way by applying a technique called <i>binary search</i>. Let's investigate the idea of binary
            search with this array:</p>

<pre>
// indexes   0   1   2   3    4   5    6   7   8   9  10
// values     -7  -3   3   7   11  15   17  21  24  28  30
</pre>

            <p>Let's assume that we want to find the value 17. Let's utilize the information that the values of the array
            are in order instead of going through the array from the beginning. Let's inspect the middle cell of the
            array. The middle cell is 5 (the largest index 10 divided by two). The middle cell is marked with the
            asterisk:</p>

<pre>
                                   *
// indexes   0   1   2   3    4   5    6   7   8   9  10
// values     -7  -3   3   7   11  15   17  21  24  28  30
</pre>

            <p>At the middle is the value 15, which was not the value we were looking for. We're looking for the
            value 17, so since the cells of the array are ordered by size, the value cannot be on the left side of the
            15. So we can determine that all indexes that are smaller or equal to 5 do not have the value we are
            looking for.</p>

            <p>The area where we are searching for the value we want to find can now be limited to values that are on
            the right side of the index 5, or in other words, in the indexes [6, 10] (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). In the following
            the part of the array is greyed where the searched value cannot be:</p>

<pre>
// indexes   <font color="lightgrey"> 0   1   2   3   4    5</font>    6     7   8   9  10
// values      <font color="lightgrey">-7  -3   3   7  11   15</font>   17   21  24  28  30
</pre>

            <p>Next, let's inspect the middle index of the area that we have left; the middle index of indexes 6-10. The
            middle index can be found by getting the sum of the smallest and largest index and dividing it by two:
            (6+10)/2 = 16/2 = 8. The index 8 is marked with the asterisk below.</p>

<pre>
                                                 *
// indexes   <font color="lightgrey"> 0   1   2   3   4    5</font>    6   7   8   9  10
// values      <font color="lightgrey">-7  -3   3   7  11   15</font>   17   21  24  28  30
</pre>

            <p>In index 8, we have the value 24, which was not the value we were looking for. Because the values in the
            array are ordered by size, the value we are searching for can not, in any case, be on the right side of the
            value 24. We can deduce that all indexes that are larger or equal to 8 can not contain the value we are
            looking for. The search area gets narrowed down again, the greyed areas have been dealt with:</p>

<pre>
// indexes   <font color="lightgrey"> 0   1   2   3   4    5</font>    6   7  <font color="lightgrey"> 8   9  10</font>
// values      <font color="lightgrey">-7  -3   3   7  11   15</font>   17   21  <font color=
"lightgrey">24  28  30</font>
</pre>

            <p>The search continues. Let's inspect the middle index of the area that we have left to search, that is, the
            middle index of indexes 6-7. The middle index can again be found out by getting the sum of the smallest and
            largest index of the search area and then dividing it by two: (6+7)/2 = 6.5, which is rounded down to 6.
            The spot has been marked with the asterisk.</p>

<pre>
                                         *
// indexes   <font color="lightgrey"> 0   1   2   3   4    5</font>    6    7  <font color=
"lightgrey"> 8   9  10</font>
// values      <font color="lightgrey">-7  -3   3   7  11   15</font>   17   21  <font color=
"lightgrey">24  28  30</font>
</pre>

            <p>In the index 6 we have the value 17, which is the same as the value we've been looking for. We can
            stop the search and report that the value we searched for is in the array. If the value wouldn't have
            been in the array - for example if the searched-for value would've been 16 - the search area would have
            eventually been reduced to nothing.</p>

<pre>
                                         *
// indexes   <font color="lightgrey"> 0   1   2   3   4    5</font><font color="red">6</font>   7  <font color=
"lightgrey"> 8   9  10</font>
// values      <font color="lightgrey">-7  -3   3   7  11   15</font><font color="red">17</font>  21  <font color=
"lightgrey">24  28  30</font>
</pre>

            <p>So for the idea of binary search to become clear to you, simulate with pen and paper how the binary
            search works when the array is the one below and first you're searching for value 33 and then value
            1.</p>

<pre>
// indexes   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13
// values     -5  -2   3   5   8  11  14  20  22  26  29  33  38  41
</pre>

            <p>With the help of binary search we look for cells by always halving the inspected area. This enables us
            to search in a very efficient way. For example, an array of size 16 can be divided in half up to 4
            times, so 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1. On the other hand, an array that has 16777216 cells can be
            halved up to 24 times. This means that with binary search we only need to inspect up to 24 cells in an
            array that has 16777216 cells in order to find our desired cell.</p>

            <p><em>The efficiency of binary search can be inspected with logarithms. A base two logarithm
            (<code>log<sub>2</sub></code>) of the number 16777216 is 24 -- with the base two logarithm we can calculate
            how many times a number can be halved. Respectively the base two logarithm of the nubmer 4294967296
            (<code>log<sub>2</sub> 4294967296</code>) is 32. This means that searching from a sorted array of
            4294967296 different values would only take up to 32 cell inspections. Efficiency is an essential part of
            computer science.</em></p>

                    <h3 class="req">Guessing game</h3>

                    <p>In this assignment we'll make an AI, which guesses the number the player is thinking about.
                    The AI assumes that the number is between <em>lowerLimit</em>...<em>upperLimit</em>. The start of
                    the game provides these limits to the method as parameters that makes the game happen. The AI asks
                    the player questions in the format "Is your number greater than X?" and deduce the
                    correct answer from the answers the player gives.</p>

                    <p>The AI keeps track of the search area with the help of the variables lowerLimit and upperLimit.
                    The AI always asks if the player's number is greater than the average of these two numbers, and
                    based on the answers the search area gets halved each time. In the end the lowerLimit and
                    upperLimit are the same and the number the user is thinking of has been revealed.</p>

                    <p>In the following example the user chooses the number 44:</p>

<pre>
Think of a number between 1...100.
I promise you that I can guess the number you are thinking of with 7 questions.

Next I'll present you a series of questions. Answer them honestly.

Is your number larger than 50? (y/n)
<font color="red">n</font>
Is your number larger than 25? (y/n)
<font color="red">y</font>
Is your number larger than 38? (y/n)
<font color="red">y</font>
Is your number larger than 44? (y/n)
<font color="red">n</font>
Is your number larger than 41? (y/n)
<font color="red">y</font>
Is your number larger than 43? (y/n)
<font color="red">y</font>
The number you're thinking of is 44.
</pre>

                    <p>In the above example the possible value range is first 1...100. When the user tells the program
                    that the number is not greater than 50 the possible range is 1...50. When the user says that the
                    number is greater than 25, the range is 26...50. The deduction proceeds in the same fashion until
                    the number 44 is reached.</p>

                    <p>In accordance to the principles of halving, or binary search, the possible search area is halved
                    after each question in which case the number of required questions is small. Even between the
                    numbers 1...100000 it shouldn't take more than 20 questions.</p>

                    <p>The program skeleton of the class <code>GuessingGame</code> that implements this is the
                    following:</p>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public boolean isGreaterThan(Scanner reader, int value)</code>, which
                    presents the user with a question:</p>

<pre>
"Is your number larger than <em>given value</em>? (y/n)"
</pre>

                    <p>The method returns the value <code>true</code> if the user replies "y", otherwise
                    <code>false</code>.</p>

                    <p>Test your method</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    GuessingGame game = new GuessingGame();

    System.out.println(game.isGreaterThan(reader, 32));
</pre>

<pre>
Is your number greater than 32? (y/n)
<font color="red">y</font>
true
</pre>

                    <h4>Average</h4>

                    <p>Implement the method <code>public int average(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)</code>, which
                    calculates the average of the given values. Notice that Java rounds floating numbers down automatically,
                    in our case this is perfectly fine.</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    GuessingGame game = new GuessingGame();
    System.out.println(game.average(3, 4));
</pre>

<pre>
3
</pre>

<pre class="sh_java">
   GuessingGame game = new GuessingGame(); 
   System.out.println(game.average(6, 12));
</pre>

<pre>
9
</pre>

                    <h4>Guessing logic</h4>

                    <p>Write the actual guessing logic in the method <code>play</code> of the class
                    <code>GuessingGame</code>. You'll need at least one loop and a query in which you ask the user
                    if their number is greater than the average of the lowerLimit and upperLimit. Change the upperLimit
                    or lowerLimit depending on the user's reply.</p>

                    <p>Keep doing the loop until lowerLimit and upperLimit are the same! You can also test the game
                    with smaller lower- and upperLimit values:</p>

<pre>
Think of a number between 1...4.
I promise you that I can guess the number you are thinking of with 2 questions.

Next I'll present you with a series of questions. Answer them honestly.

Is your number larger than 2? (y/n)
<font color="red">k</font>
Is your number larger than 3? (y/n)
<font color="red">k</font>
The number you're thinking of is 4.

                    <h3>Implementation of binary search</h3>

                    <p>The template you get from the test automaton has a start for an implementation of binary search.
                    The class <code>BinarySearch</code> holds a method <code>public static boolean search(int[] array,
                    int searchedValue)</code>, the job of which is to figure out, by using binary search, if the
                    value given as a parameter is in the sorted array that is also given as parameter.</p>

                    <p>The method <code>search</code> does not work yet, however. Finish the method's
                    implementation into a real binary search.</p>

                    <p>For testing, a separate main program can be found in the class <code>Main</code>, which has a
                    frame like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Here you can test binary search
    int[] array = { -3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12 };
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("Values of the array: " + Arrays.toString(array));
    System.out.println();

    System.out.print("Enter searched number: ");
    String searchedValue = reader.nextLine();
    System.out.println();

    boolean result = BinarySearch.search(array,
Integer.parseInt(searchedValue));

    // Print the binary search result here
  }
}
</pre>

                    <p>The execution of the program looks like this:</p>

<pre>
Values of the array: [-3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12]

Enter searcher number: <font color="red">8</font>

Value 8 is in the array
</pre>

<pre>
Values of the array: [-3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12]

Enter searcher number: <font color="red">99</font>

Value 99 is not in the array
</pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>About arrays and objects</h2>

            <p>If need be, any type of object can be put into an array. In the following, an example of an array into
            which will be put <em>Person</em> objects:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person[] persons = new Person[3];

        persons[0] = new Person("Pekka");
        persons[1] = new Person("Antti");
        persons[2] = new Person("Juhana");

        for ( int i=0; i &lt; 30; i++ ) {
            persons[0].becomeOlder();
            persons[1].becomeOlder();
            persons[2].becomeOlder();
        }

        for ( Person person : persons ) {
            reportMaturity(person);
        }
    }
</pre>

            <p>First we create an array that can hold 3 Person objects. We put Pekka in slot 0, Antti in 1 and Juhana
            in 2. We age all by 30 years and check all of their matureness with the help of the method from the
            previous chapter.</p>

            <p>The same example with ArrayLists:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; persons = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();

        persons.add( new Person("Pekka") );
        persons.add( new Person("Antti") );
        persons.add( new Person("Juhana") );

        for ( int i=0; i &lt; 30; i++ ) {
            for ( Person person : persons ) {
                person.becomeOlder();
            }

            //  or persons.get(0).becomeOlder();
            //     persons.get(1).becomeOlder();
            //     ...
        }

        for ( Person person : persons ) {
            reportMaturity(person);
        }
    }
</pre>

            <p>In most situations it's better to use ArrayList intead of an array. However there can be cases where
            an array is adequate and is simpler to use.</p>

            <p>A week always consists of seven days. It would be meaningful to form it out of exactly 7 Day objects. Since
            there's always 7 Day objects, an array will suit the situation very well:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
public class Day {
    private String name;
    // ...
}

public class Week {
    private Day[] days;

    public Week(){
        days = new int[7];
        days[0] = new Day("Monday");
        days[1] = new Day("Tuesday");
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>
